# Narrative Policy (effective 1 March 2025)

Only two narrative formats are approved:

- LCHART: Location, Chief Complaint, History, Assessment, Rx/Treatment, Transport
- DRAATT: Dispatch, Response, Arrival, Assessment, Treatment, Transport

All EMTs, Paramedics, and Captains must use one of these formats for every patient encounter.
Any other format is non-compliant.
