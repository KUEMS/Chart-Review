Introduction:
The EMS protocols contained within this document are intended to ensure standardized treatment for all patients receiving
care from EMS agencies and providers participating in the International SOS Government Medical Services (GMS) EMS
Programs. These protocols are exclusively applicable to agencies and providers operating under the authority of the
International SOS GMS EMS Programs. Any other use must receive prior approval from the International SOS GMS EMS
Medical Director.
These protocols are the product of extensive review, incorporating evidence-based guidelines, historically validated
treatments, and best practices from internationally recognized EMS systems. It is our intent that this document serves as a
valuable resource for education, training, and reference, thereby enabling the International SOS GMS EMS Programs to
consistently deliver the highest quality of pre-hospital care. While every effort has been made to cover a wide array of
patient care scenarios, unforeseen circumstances or unique patient care needs may arise. In such cases, EMS providers
should rely on their education, experience, clinical judgment, and the principles of patient-centered care to deliver optimal
outcomes. Online Medical Control remains available at all times for consultation and assistance with any situation or
patient presentation not explicitly addressed within these protocols.
Acknowledgements:
These protocols have undergone rigorous review by the International SOS GMS EMS Medical Director, the Medical Advisory
Committee, and representatives from various sectors of the medical community. The goal is to provide uniformity and
consistency in patient treatment across all provider levels. The protocols have been assessed for clinical relevance,
practicality, and internal consistency. While perfection is challenging to achieve, it is our sincere belief that this document
represents a comprehensive and robust protocol framework aligned with, if not exceeding, internationally recognized EMS
standards. International SOS GMS EMS Programs acknowledges and appreciates the contributions and efforts of all
individuals and groups involved in the creation and review of this document.
“Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.”

Guidelines for Use of Protocols:
In general, the protocols are divided into Adult and Pediatric sections, with subheadings for Medical and Trauma. For
pediatric patients, the appropriate pediatric-specific protocol should be used if one exists. If there is no pediatric-specific
protocol for a condition, use the adult protocol but use weight-based dosing for medications. The adult dose of a
medication should never be exceeded for a pediatric patient.
There have been significant updates from previous versions of the EMS protocols. While the core purpose—to deliver the
highest quality, patient-centered care—remains unchanged, this edition represents a substantially revised and updated
document. A summary of the primary formatting changes is provided below; however, it does not substitute for a thorough
review of the protocol document itself. Providers should take adequate time to become familiar with the new structure,
content, and workflow of the updated protocols.
In order to make the flowcharts easier to read, a standardized presentation has been adopted. For circumstances
where an EMS Provider needs to make a decision, the question appears in a diamond-shaped box with the answers
coming off in separate, usually opposite directions. For simplicity, every attempt was made to make these “yes/no”
or dichotomous decisions whenever possible.
When an EMS Provider is referenced to another PROTOCOL within the book, the name of the Protocol appears in a
rectangular box, with a lime-green shadow.
If there is a bi-directional arrow referencing another PROTOCOL, the intention is that the EMS Provider returns to
the current Protocol after a critical assessment or treatment is completed in the referenced Protocol. For example,
a bi-directional arrow referencing the Airway Management, Adult Protocol would imply that after the airway has
been addressed that the Provider return to the current Protocol for further evaluation and patient management.
When an EMS Provider is referenced to a PROCEDURE within the book, the name of the Procedure appears in a
rectangular box, with a purple shadow.
When medications are referenced in the Protocol, they are coded to the level of the EMS Provider with a key
attached to the left side of the medication box. Procedures and medications that are in the scope of EMR providers
have a CLEAR box attached to the left side, EMTs have a GRAY box with the letter B, Advanced EMTs have a
YELLOW box with the letter A and Paramedics have a BLUE box with the letter P. Any time Medical Control must be
contacted for approval or authorization, the key is RED with the letter M. The Legend appears in the top left corner
of all Protocols for reference. Rather than have multiple boxes attached to each medication, the supposition is that
all providers credentialed at a level higher than the key are authorized to administer the medication. For example,
albuterol has a clear box in the key and is authorized for the EMR, EMT, Advanced EMT and Paramedic.
Under the heading for each Protocol, there are two sections immediately below entitled, “Pertinent Positives and
Negatives” and “Differential”. These boxes are meant to be a guide to assist with the pertinent historical information as
well as a reminder of the multiple potential causes for a patient presentation that should be considered by the EMS
Provider. It is expected that these elements be considered in the patient evaluation and appear in the documentation for
the call.
Finally, the “Pearls” section at the bottom of the page provides further guidance as well as some tips to keep in mind when
assessing patients and scenes. It is impossible to condense all of Emergency Medicine into a single page flow chart, but the
pearls section allows for expanded medical advice, dosages and descriptions of special situations. Please study these
sections along with the rest of the flowcharts – there is likely something to learn on every page!
These protocols are the basis of the care we provide. Combined with your experience and education, this document
should help you provide patient care that rivals the best in the world.

Dedication:
These protocols are dedicated to you, the EMS Providers of International SOS Government Medical Services. Your
unwavering dedication, commitment to continuous improvement, and solemn promise to care for the sick and injured are
what define the exceptional quality and compassion of our EMS community. While missed time with family and friends
occurs too often and expressions of gratitude come too infrequently, know that your efforts and sacrifices are deeply
appreciated.
Some people spend their entire lives wondering if they made a difference—you don’t have that problem.
Honoring Our Fallen Responders:
We respectfully honor and remember all EMS, Fire, and Law Enforcement personnel who have fallen in the line of duty.
Thank you for your dedication, sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to the safety and well-being of your communities.
“Use your skills, your knowledge, your instincts to serve – to go change the world in the way that only you can.”

Purpose:
To provide guidelines for the transport of patients with Time Critical Diagnoses (TCDs) to the most appropriate facility that can provide
definitive level care.
Policy:
When feasible, patients AND/OR their healthcare power of attorney should be permitted to make autonomous decisions regarding their
destination hospital, and given the opportunity to choose. Occasionally, patients may need to be directed away from their preferred institution
in favor of a specialty resource center, which can provide advanced levels of care not available at every hospital . In those instances, the EMS
Provider’s decision should be calmly and respectfully communicated to the patient and their family. By keeping a patient-centered focus and
always working to do what is right for the patient, transport to the most appropriate level of care will hopefully be an obvious decision. At the
time of publication, the following centers have achieved the appropriate level of credentialing for each of the Time Critical Diagnoses (TCDs)
and Specialty Resource Center listed:
Any patient who is judged to be too unstable for transfer to definitive care may be transported to the closest Emergency Depa rtment for
immediate stabilization
