Purpose:
To provide general guidelines for the appropriate utilization of Helicopter EMS (HEMS) Response during routine daily operations.
Policy:
EMS Providers are trained and equipped to manage emergency situations. Occasionally, a situation occurs that may benefit from care beyond
the scope or resources of an EMS provider, such as utilization of HEMS.
Helicopter EMS activation should be considered in Time Critical Diagnoses (TCDs) when transport via helicopter is anticipated to provide a
significant time advantage over ground transport in the delivery of the patient to definitive care. Examples of when HEMS may be beneficial to
consider:
q Patient has a TCD (e.g. major trauma, STEMI, stroke) and HEMS will meaningfully shorten the time of delivery of the patient to definitive
care. Consideration for situations where scene time may be prolonged (such as extrication) HEMS may offer additional time savings.
q Patient is located in a geographically isolated area, which would make ground transport difficult or delayed.
q Patient is likely to require high-level life support available from HEMS, which isn’t readily available by ground transport.
q Local EMS resources are exceeded (e.g. mass casualty incident with multiple critically ill or injured patients), when activation would not put
responding HEMS unit at increased risk (e.g. active shooter without neutralized threat).
Procedure:
q The highest credentialed EMS Provider on scene will determine if HEMS response is appropriate for the patient.
q When considering air transport, the following terminology should be referenced when speaking with HEMS Dispatch:
 “Status Inquiry” or “Inquiry” - contact asking whether HEMS is available to fly or not based on current weather conditions , aircraft
availability and crew status. An aircraft will NOT be reserved.
 “Stand-by” - aircraft will be pulled out and prepared for flight with blades turning and ready to lift. If the aircraft has not been
“Requested” or stood down by that point, HEMS will “launch and stage” in the air approximately 5 nautical miles from the scene.
 “Request” - final decision has been made by the EMS Provider(s) on scene to transport the patient by air, and the helicopter will launch
(or proceed if already airborne) to the scene or rendezvous point as soon as possible.
q A safe Landing Zone (LZ) must be established per International SOS EMS Protocols prior to HEMS arrival. At night, clearly mark the LZ with
flares, strobes, vehicle lights, or other suitable ground-based lighting.
q Patients coming from a Hazardous Materials (HazMat) scene need to be fully decontaminated prior to HEMS transport. This includes
contamination with various fuels as well as ingestions of volatile substances which may cause off -gassing.
q Under NO circumstances should patient transport be delayed to use a helicopter.
Multiple pre-designated helicopter landing zones (LZs) may be available that do not require additional setup by fire or law enforcement personnel. EMS
providers may use these LZs if appropriate based on weather, patient condition, and safety considerations.
Minimum Medevac Landing Zone Criteria:
Size: At least 100 ft x 100 ft (30 m x 30 m), level, firm surface
Clearance: Free of overhead obstructions (wires, poles, trees)
Marking: Clearly indicated with cones, lights, or reflective markers (avoid flares if possible)
Visibility: Clear of smoke, dust, or other visibility hazards
Security: Restricted from unauthorized personnel and vehicle traffic
