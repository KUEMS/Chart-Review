Purpose:
To provide general guidelines for the appropriate utilization of EMS Physician Response during routine daily operations.
Policy:
EMS Providers are trained and equipped to manage emergency situations. Occasionally, a situation occurs that may benefit from care beyond
the scope or resources of an EMS provider, such as utilization of EMS Physician Response.
EMS Physicians who are knowledgeable about local EMS and healthcare resources, may be beneficial to support EMS providers in the rare
situation when advanced skills, authority, or access to hospital resources may be warranted. EMS Physician response DOES NOT replace ALS
resources. Examples of when EMS Physician Response may be beneficial to consider:
q Patient requires specialized medical attention in the field that is beyond the scope of the EMS Providers present on scene or available at
the time of the emergency (i.e. field amputation).
q Mass Casualty Incident with multiple critically ill or injured patients. Physicians can provide on scene medical support or provision of treat/
release and/or alternative destination recommendations.
q Expanding events with unclear patient involvement or community threats.
Procedure:
q The highest credentialed EMS Provider on scene will determine if EMS Physician response is appropriate for the patient .
q EMS providers should request dispatch of the closest, most appropriate EMS Physician Response Unit, if available.
