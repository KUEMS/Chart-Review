Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)
Purpose:
To clarify Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) guidelines and outline specific exceptions when standard resuscitation may or may not apply.
Policy:
A valid Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order directs EMS providers not to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation if the patient experiences cardiac or respiratory
arrest. "Resuscitation" includes chest compressions, artificial ventilation, advanced airway management, defibrillation, administration of cardiac
medications, and related procedures. It does not include procedures to clear airway obstructions, such as abdominal or chest thrusts.
Valid DNR orders are typically indicated by an approved identification bracelet. Commonly accepted bracelets include hospital-style plastic ID
bands or authorized metal medical-alert bracelets. EMS providers should be familiar with and recognize all identification methods approved by
local, national, or international authorities.
Patients with valid DNR orders should still receive supportive EMS care per International SOS EMS Protocols, including airway management,
supplemental oxygen, comfort positioning, splinting, hemorrhage control, pain management, emotional support, and transport to an
appropriate medical facility for evaluation.
DNR orders shall be followed by EMS Providers, except in the following situations:
q The Do-Not-Resuscitate bracelet appears to have been tampered with or removed
q The emergency medical technician, first responder or member of the emergency health care facility knows that the patient is pregnant
q The Do-Not-Resuscitate order is revoked. Methods for revocation may occur at any time by the following (154.21):
 The patient expresses to an emergency medical technician, first responder or to a person who serves as a member of an emergency
health care facility’s personnel the desire to be resuscitated. The emergency medical technician, first responder or the member of the
emergency health care facility shall promptly remove the do-not-resuscitate bracelet.
 The patient defaces, burns, cuts or otherwise destroys the do-not-resuscitate bracelet.
 The patient removed the do-not-resuscitate bracelet or another person, at the patient’s request, removed the do-not-resuscitate
bracelet.
q The Guardian or Health Care Agent of an incapacitated qualified patient may direct an emergency medical technician , first responder or a
person who serves as a member of an emergency health care facility's personnel to resuscitate the patient. The emergency medical
technician, first responder or the member of the emergency health care facility shall promptly remove the do-not-resuscitate bracelet.
(154.225)
Under Wisconsin Statute 154.23, no physician, emergency medical technician, first responder, health care professional or emergency health
care facility may be held criminally or civilly liable, or charged with unprofessional conduct, for any of the following:
q Under the directive of a do-not-resuscitate order, withholding or withdrawing, or causing to be withheld or withdrawn, resuscitation from a
patient.
q Failing to act upon the revocation of a do-not-resuscitate order unless the person or facility had actual knowledge of the revocation.
q Failing to comply with a do-not-resuscitate order if the person or facility did not have actual knowledge of the do-not-resuscitate order or if
the person or facility in good faith believed that the order had been revoked.
