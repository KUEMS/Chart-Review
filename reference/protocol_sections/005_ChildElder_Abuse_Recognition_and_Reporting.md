# Section 5: Child/Elder Abuse Recognition and Reporting

---

Child/Elder Abuse Recognition and Reporting
Purpose:
To provide guidelines for the EMS Provider who encounters suspected and/or confirmed cases of child or elder abuse while on duty.
Policy:
Child Abuse is the physical and mental injury, sexual abuse, negligent treatment and/or maltreatment of a child under the age of 18 by a person who is
responsible for the child’s welfare. The recognition of abuse and the proper reporting is a critical step to improving the safety of children and preventing child
abuse.
An elderly person is typically defined as an individual aged 60 or older. Elder abuse includes physical, emotional, or sexual harm, neglect, or maltreatment
inflicted by caregivers, family members, or acquaintances. Recognizing signs of abuse and promptly reporting concerns are critical steps toward protecting the
health and safety of elderly individuals.
Effective management of a case of suspected abuse or neglect is based upon the following:
q Protect the patient from harm
q Suspect that the patient may be a victim of abuse, especially if the illness/injury is not consistent with the reported
history
q Respect the privacy of the patient and the family
q Collect as much information as possible, and preserve any physical evidence
Any suspicion or evidence of abuse or neglect must be immediately reported to law enforcement or protective services upon arrival at the receiving facility. If
patient contact does not result in transport, notify authorities prior to clearing the scene. Incidents occurring outside your primary service area should be
reported to local authorities responsible for that jurisdiction.
There are many subtle signs of abuse that may be missed without a high index of suspicion. ALL patients evaluated by EMS should be screened for these cues.
Some include:
Psychological cues – excessively passive behavior, fearful behavior, excessive aggression, violent tendencies, excessive or inappropriate crying, substance
abuse, medical noncompliance or repeat EMS requests for seemingly minor problems.
Physical cues – injuries inconsistent with the reported mechanism, defensive injuries (i.e. forearms), injuries during pregnancy are suggestive of abuse.
Multiple bruises and injuries in various stages of healing may also suggest repeated violence against the victim.
Signs of neglect – inappropriate level of clothing for weather, poor hygiene, absence of and/or inattentive caregivers, poor living conditions and physical signs
of malnutrition.
EMS Providers in the State of Wisconsin are required by law to report suspected cases of child abuse and neglect as well as those situations in which they
have reason to believe that a child / elder has been treated with abuse or neglect or that abuse or neglect will occur.
For Suspected Elder Abuse or Neglect -
q For elder abuse or neglect occurring outside of licensed facilities, contact the appropriate local human services or elder protection agency helpline.
q For elder abuse or neglect cases occurring within licensed nursing homes, contact the appropriate local regulatory authority or division responsible for
nursing home oversight.
q For elder abuse or neglect cases occurring within licensed assisted living facilities, community-based residential facilities, or adult family homes, contact the
appropriate local regulatory agency responsible for oversight of these facilities.
q For elder abuse or neglect cases occurring outside your local operational area, contact the appropriate elder care or protective services agency designated
for that region.
For Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect -
Contact the appropriate local Protective Services agency:
q If caregivers are refusing the evaluation or treatment of a child that you suspect may be the victim of abuse or neglect, do not hesitate to contact Medical
Control for advice. If necessary, Law Enforcement may be consulted to help settle disagreements on scene, while maintaining the effective management
principles above.
q If a child has a life- or limb-threatening condition and caregivers refuse evaluation or transport, initiate immediate transport to the closest appropriate
facility. Simultaneously notify law enforcement and seek immediate guidance from Online Medical Control. If your Medical Director is unavailable,
contact alternate medical oversight as appropriate.
q When abuse or suspected abuse is reported to Law Enforcement, it is required that name and badge number of the officer receiving the report be captured
in your documentation.
