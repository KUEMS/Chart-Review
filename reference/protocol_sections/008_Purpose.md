# Section 8: Purpose:

---

Purpose:
To provide guidelines and resources for the EMS Provider who encounters suspected and/or confirmed cases of domestic violence while on
duty.
Policy:
Domestic Violence is physical, sexual or psychological abuse and/or intimidation which attempts to control another person in a current or
former family, dating or household relationship. The recognition, appropriate reporting and referral of abuse is an essential step to improving
patient safety, providing quality care and preventing further abuse.
Effective management of a case of suspected abuse or neglect is based upon the following:
q Protect the patient from harm
q Suspect that the patient may be a victim of abuse, especially if the illness/injury is not consistent with the reported history
q Respect the privacy of the patient and the family
q Collect as much information as possible, and preserve physical evidence
Any findings of abuse or neglect OR suspicion of abuse or neglect must be handled with sensitivity and delicacy by the EMS Pr ovider.
Provision of emotional support is key, without passing judgment on the victim or alleged perpetrator of domestic violence. Discretion should be
a high priority, and when possible questions regarding abuse and safety should be done in private . Offering the resources below to the patient
may feel awkward at the time, but are excellent resources and may be used at any time in the future. Have a low threshold to transport
patients of suspected or confirmed domestic violence, as they may not have other means of escaping their assailant and accessing resources
that may be available at the hospital.
There are many subtle signs of abuse that may be missed without a high index of suspicion. Some include:
Psychological cues – excessively passive in nature, fearful behavior, excessive aggression, violent tendencies, excessive or inappropriate crying,
substance abuse, medical noncompliance or repeat EMS requests for seemingly minor problems.
Physical cues – injuries inconsistent with the reported mechanism, defensive injuries (i.e. forearms), injuries during pregnancy are suggestive of
abuse. Multiple bruises and injuries in various stages of healing may also suggest repeated violence against the victim.
Signs of neglect – inappropriate level of clothing for weather, poor hygiene, absence of and/or inattentive caregivers, poor living conditions and
physical signs of malnutrition.
For Suspected Domestic Violence –
q EMS providers should privately offer victims contact information for local domestic violence intervention services or a 24-hour crisis helpline
available in the region.
q EMS Providers may also provide the National Hotline (800) 799-SAFE (7233) inside the United States.
q Depending on the situation, transport should be considered regardless of the illness or injury, so that the victim may receive the expert
consultation and additional services that are available in the Emergency Department .
