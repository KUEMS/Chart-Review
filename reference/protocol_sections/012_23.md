Paramedic Intercept Guidelines
Policies
Purpose:
To outline circumstances in which an Advanced Life Support (ALS) Service should be requested for intercept with a non-ALS level Service.
Policy:
The situations listed below are not all-inclusive, but are intended to serve as examples of when a higher level of care would be appropriate for
advanced interventions and patient safety. In addition to advanced skills and additional medication options, Paramedics also bring an
experience with critically ill and injured patients, and can assist with the safe evaluation and destination determination process.
While patient care remains the highest priority for all EMS providers, decisions to request an ALS intercept should consider factors such as time of
day, traffic conditions, weather, and proximity to appropriate medical care. When feasible, arrangements should be made to rendezvous with ALS
units en route to minimize delays in providing advanced skills and medications.
Some examples of patients that may benefit from ALS level evaluation and management include but are not limited to ;
q Sepsis
q Cardiopulmonary Arrest
q Altered Mental Status not explained by simple hypoglycemia or opiate overdose
q Severe Respiratory Distress AND/OR Impending Airway Compromise
q Multi-System Trauma
q Unstable or Deteriorating Vital Signs
q Chest Pain with Hemodynamically Compromising Dysrhythmia
q ST-Segment Elevation MI with Hypotension, Altered Mental Status or Impending Cardiac Arrest
q Complex Seizures (First Seizure without History, Seizure After Head Injury, Recurrent Seizure without Return to Baseline)
q Allergic Reaction assessed to be ‘Severe’ or ‘Impending Cardiac Arrest’
q Asthma Exacerbation not improving after Albuterol OR Requiring Multiple Nebs
q Complications of Childbirth
q Mass Casualty Incident
q Any situation in which the EMS provider or Medical Control determines ALS evaluation and management are necessary.
We are all working together to get the right patient to the right level of care at the right time!
