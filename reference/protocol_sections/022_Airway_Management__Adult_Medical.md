Notify Receiving Facility,
Contact Medical Control As Necessary
P Rapid Sequence Airway
Preparation
IV, O2, Continuous Cardiac Monitor, SpO2, EtCO2, BP
Check Laryngoscope Bulb, Check video laryngoscope function, ETT Balloon, Stylet,
Syringes, Optimize Positioning
Prepare Rescue Airway Device
Medications Drawn Up and Labeled
Optimize hemodynamics and consider preparing a push dose Epinephrine (p190)
Preoxygenate
100% O2 x 5 Minutes
8 Vital Capacity Breaths via BVM or NRB
Continue Until Airway Secured
Continue apneic oxygenation via Nasal Cannula throughout procedure
Pretreatment
Consider Cricoid Pressure (Sellick’s Maneuver)
Coordinate with crew re: order of meds, anticipated course and contingency plans
Paralysis and Induction
Etomidate 0.3mg/kg IV/IO (max 30mg) OR
Ketamine 2mg/kg IV/IO (max 200mg)
THEN
Succinylcholine 2mg/kg IV/IO (max 200mg) OR
Rocuronium 1.0mg/kg (max 100mg)
Placement with Proof
Continuous EtCO2 Monitoring
Auscultation, Chest Rise, Fogging in Tube
Secure Device
Post Placement Management
Indications for Adult Rapid Sequence
Airway Management
Determining whether RSA is indicated for a patient is
multifactorial, requires experienced clinical judgement, and a
robust training/QA support system. These indications to
consider RSA are meant to serve as guidelines and RSA should
not be considered if unable to ventilate with BVM unless all
other options have been exhausted.
Failure to oxygenate
Failure to ventilate
Failure of airway protection
Post-Advanced Airway Sedation Adult p34
Each Attempt should include change in approach, operator and/
or equipment
If endotracheal tube placement is attempted, after two (2)
unsuccessful attempts move towards alternative airway device

Rapid Sequence Airway - Adult
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Head, Neck, Blood Glucose, Lung Exam, Posterior Pharynx
 Resuscitate first, hemodynamically unstable patients are at high risk for cardiac arrest.
 Digital capnography is the standard of care and is to be used with all methods of advanced airway management and endotracheal intubation. If a service uses color change
capnometry only and an Invasive Airway Device is placed, an intercept with a digital capnography capable service MUST be completed.
 If Airway Management is adequately maintained with a Bag-Valve Mask and waveform SpO2 >93%, it is acceptable to defer advanced airway placement in favor of basic
maneuvers and rapid transport to the hospital.
 Gastric decompression with Oral Gastric Tube should be considered on all patients with advanced airways, if time and situation allows.
 Once secured, every effort should be made to keep the endotracheal tube in the airway; commercially available tube holders and C-collars are good adjuncts.
 For all protocols, an Advanced Airway Attempt is defined as passing the tip of the laryngoscope blade or Blindly Inserted Airway Device (BIAD) tube past the teeth.
 Recent history of Upper Respiratory Infection, Missing / Loose Teeth or Dentures all will increase complexity of airway management.
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
