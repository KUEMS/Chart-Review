Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Nature of Complaint
 Paralytics block movement of skeletal muscle but do NOT change awareness. Remember that without sedation, patients may be awake but paralyzed.
 Monitor Vital Signs closely when managing airways and sedation. Changes that indicate pain, anxiety as well as tube dislodgment may be subtle (at first)!
 Document Vital Signs before and after administration of every medication to prove effectiveness.
 ANY change in patient condition, reassess from the beginning. Use the mnemonic DOPE (Dislodgment, Obstruction, Pneumothorax, Equipment) to troubleshoot problems
with the ET Tube.
 Continuous End Tidal CO2 is mandatory for all intubated patients – color change is NOT sufficient proof of ET Tube in the trachea.
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, BP, RR, SpO2
 SAMPLE history
 OPQRST history
Differential
 Cardiac Dysrhythmia
 Hypoglycemia
 Overdose
 Toxidrome
 Sepsis
 Occult Trauma
 Adrenal Insufficiency
 Mental Status
 Pale, Cool Skin
 Delayed Cap Refill

It is critical that we do not administer
