12-Lead ECG Procedure p129
CHF / Pulmonary Edema - Adult
General Approach – Adult, Medical

Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Head, Neck, Blood Glucose
 If CHF / Cardiogenic Shock is from inferior MI (II, III, aVF), consider RIGHT sided ECG
 If ST Elevation in V3, V4 OR Inferior Leads (II, III, aVF), Nitroglycerin may cause severe hypotension requiring IV Fluid boluses
 NTG goal is 20% reduction in SBP or symptom relief. If patient reports no relief with home Nitroglycerin, consider potency of medication (is the medicine expired? Would
EMS supply be useful?)
 BE CAUTIOUS – Benzodiazepines may worsen respiratory depression, altered mental status, agitation especially if recent EtOH or illicit drug use. This med should be
considered with EXTREME caution. All efforts should be made to verbally coach compliance PRIOR to BZD use in respiratory distress
Medical Protocols - Adult

 Pulmonary Embolism
 Congestive Heart Failure
 Toxic Exposure
 COPD Exacerbation
 Acute Renal Failure
 Home meds used prior to call (Digoxin,
Lasix, Viagra, Cialis)
 Respiratory Distress, Rales
 Orthopnea, JVD
 Pink, Frothy Sputum

No Consider Sepsis Screening Protocol When
Appropriate p62
P
Nitroglycerin Paste (If Available)
 SBP >100, 1 inch of paste
 SBP >150, 1.5 inches of paste
 SBP >200, 2 inches of paste
Note: For SBP >200, NTG Paste will
likely not have a significant impact on
BP; consider SL NTG
P
Consider Midazolam 2mg IV/IN or
Ketamine 0.25mg/kg IV/IM/IO
(max 25mg)
If needed for CPAP compliance
