# Section 27: CONSIDER CORRECTABLE CAUSES OF ARRHYTHMIA:

---

CONSIDER CORRECTABLE CAUSES OF ARRHYTHMIA:
Hypoxia – Secure airway and ventilate
Hypothermia – Active Rewarming
Hydrogen Ion (acidosis) – secure airway and ventilate
Toxins:
Narcotic OD – Naloxone 2mg IV/IO/IN/IM
Cardiac Arrest - Adult
38
CPR Quality
 Push Hard (at least 2 inches) and fast (100-120/min) and allow complete chest recoil
 Minimize interruptions in compressions
 Avoid excessive ventilation
 Rotate compressors every 2 minutes, sooner if fatigued
 If no advanced airway, 30:2 compression: ventilation ratio
 Quantitative waveform capnography
 If EtCO2 <10mmHg, attempt to improve CPR quality
 Consider Mechanical CPR device by 6 minutes of resuscitation; may consider sooner if
resources allow
 Consider advanced airway placement by 6 mnutes of resuscitation; may consider sooner
if resources allow
High Performance CPR (HPCPR)
HPCPR is an emphasis on communication, efficient movement
of resuscitationists, and an increased emphasis on the BASICS
that improves outcomes
CONSIDER ALS EARLY if not auto dispatched
If at any time Patient has Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) Go to Post Resuscitation
Protocol p40
Drug Therapy
Epinephrine IV/IO dose: 1mg every 3-5 minutes
Consider Max 5 doses epi IF not responding to resuscitation efforts
Amiodarone IV/IO dose: First dose 300mg bolus. Second dose 150mg bolus.
*Ketamine sedation during resuscitation consider 2mg/kg IV/IO
Double Sequential Defibrillation
 Consider for cases of shock refractory V-fib or Pulseless
V-tach that have not converted after 3 defibrillation
attempts AND >1 dose of ACLS medication
 There is the potential to cause damage to equipment
when performing this procedure. Therefore, it is
recommended to be attempted using an AED and a
monitor to minimize risk.
 Because of the potential for adverse equipment results,
it is important that your Service Director and Medical
Director approve this procedure BEFORE attempting
Advanced Airway
 Endotracheal Intubation or supraglottic airway
 Waveform capnography to confirm and monitor ET tube
placement
 Once advanced airway in place, give 1 breath every 6
seconds (10 breaths/min) with continuous chest
compressions
Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)
 Pulse and blood pressure
 Abrupt sustained increase in ETCO2 (typically >40mmHg)
Pearls
RECOMMENDED EXAM: Mental Status, Pulse, Initial and Final Rhythm
 Immediately after defibrillation, resume chest compressions with a different operator compressing. Do not pause for post-shock rhythm analysis. Stop
compressions only for signs of life (patient movement) or rhythm visible through compressions on monitor or pre-defibrillation rhythm analysis every 2 minutes
and proceed to appropriate protocol.
 Based on current literature, Ventricular Fibrillation and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia patients who are successfully resuscitated should be transport ed to a
24/7 STEMI capable facility if reasonable to do so.
 In the event a patient suffers cardiac arrest in the presence of EMS, the absolute highest priority is to apply the AED/Defibrillator and deliver a shock
immediately if indicated.
 Reassess airway frequently and with every patient move. Cycle compressors frequently – compression quality deteriorates before fatigue is perceived.
 Designate a “Code Leader” to coordinate transitions, defibrillation and pharmacological interventions. “Code Leader” ideally should have no procedural tasks.
 External Compression Devices may be considered if available and will not impede patient care.
 Consider sodium bicarb early in cases of sudden cardiac arrest in Excited Delirium.
 Consider Ketamine if needed for sedation during resuscitation if patient consciousness during CPR is interfering in care.
