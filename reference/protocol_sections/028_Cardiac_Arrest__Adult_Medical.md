Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
(ECPR or “ECMO”) - Adult
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, RR, Lung Sounds, Cardiac Exam, JVD
 Goal is estimated time of arrest to on ECMO Circuit <60 minutes
 It is important to balance High Performance CPR on scene with ECPR potential; Strongly consider candidate patient if not responding to quality CPR.
 Ideally, decision to move patient should be made and transport from scene should happen in <16 minutes
 Contact ECPR-capable receiving hospital with “ECMO Alert” early; consider contact after 2
nd shock for refractory V-fib, rearrest after ROSC, EMS Discretion, etc.
 ECPR is a highly time-critical intervention; it is important to consider the patient circumstances and whether pt. could be a candidate. Consultation with ECMO center early is
a priority
 There are many variables that go into the decision to start a patient in ECPR circuit; not every candidate patient will be able to be cannulated on arrival to the ED
Inclusion Criteria for ECPR:

q Arrest is EITHER:
 Witnessed OR
 Initial Shockable Rhythm OR

q ECPR can be initiated within ~60 minutes of estimated initial arrest
q Suspect reversible cause of arrest – STEMI, massive PE, cardiac toxin
overdose, primary arrhythmia, accidental hypothermia, etc.
q ECPR and full ICU care are consistent with patient wishes (if known by family
at bedside)
Exclusions to ECPR:

Activating An “ECMO Alert”
q Contact the ECMO Capable Hospital Early
by radio. “We are on scene with a
potential ECPR Candidate”
q Over the radio, give a reliable phone
number for the Medical Control Physician
to call you back (may require
communication of HIPAA protected
patient information)
q Medical Control will call you directly to
review the case and make a decision
regarding patient candidacy for ECPR
