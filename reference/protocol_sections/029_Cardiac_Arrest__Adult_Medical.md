Pearls
RECOMMENDED EXAM: Mental Status, Pulse, Initial and Final Rhythm
 The American Heart Association no longer supports routine prehospital hypothermia induction for all out of hospital cardiac a rrests based on the most current literature.
 Acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and primary arrhythmia are the most common causes for cardiac arrest.
 Based on current literature, Ventricular Fibrillation and Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia patients who are successfully resuscitated should be transported to a 24/7 STEMI
capable facility if reasonable to do so.
 In observational studies, PaCO2 in a normal range (35 to 45 mmHg) when measured at 37°C is associated with better outcomes than higher or lower PaCO2.
 Antiarrhythmic drugs should be reserved for patients with recurrent or ongoing unstable arrhythmias.
 No data support the routine or prophylactic use of antiarrhythmic drugs after the return of spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest, even if such medications were
employed during the resuscitation.
 Determining and correcting the underlying cause of the arrhythmia (eg, electrolyte disturbance, acute myocardial ischemia, toxin ingestion) is the best intervention.
Perform and Document Complete Neurologic Exam
Optimize Ventilation and Oxygenation
SpO2 >93%
EtCO2 goal 35-45mmHg
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Events leading to arrest
 Estimated downtime
 Past Medical History
 Medications
Differential
 Medical or Trauma
 Vfib vs Pulseless Vtach
 Asystole
 Pulseless electrical activity (PEA)
 Existence of terminal illness
 Signs of lividity, rigor mortis
 Code Status (DNR)
