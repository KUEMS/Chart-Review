Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, RR, Lung Sounds, Cardiac Exam, JVD
 Avoid Nitroglycerin in any patient who has used Viagra (Sildenafil) or Levitra (Vardenafil) in the last 24 hours or Cialis (Tadalifil) in the last 36 hours
 If no IV Access, ECG MUST be obtained and reviewed by Medical Control prior to administration of Nitroglycerin (even patient supplied)
 If patient takes Aspirin immediately prior to EMS arrival, confirm the medication and expiration date. If uncertain, administer full dose aspirin
 NTG goal is 20% reduction in SBP or symptom relief. If patient reports no relief with home Nitroglycerin, consider potency of medication (is the medicine expired? Would
EMS supply be useful?)
 Use Nitroglycerin with caution if Inferior, Right Ventricle or Posterior MI is suspected
 Elderly patients, diabetics and women are more likely to have atypical chest pain – SOB, fatigue, weakness, back pain, jaw pain
 Have a low threshold to get a 12-Lead ECG. They are minimally invasive, painless and can evolve with time
 If ST Elevation in V3, V4 or Inferior Leads (II, III, aVF), Nitroglycerin may cause hypotension requiring IV Fluid Boluses

 CHF, CAD, Chest Pain History
 Home meds prior to EMS Arrival
(Digoxin, Lasix, ASA, Viagra, Cialis)
 Respiratory Distress
 Orthopnea, JVD
Differential
 Pericardial Tamponade
 Pericarditis
 Asthma / COPD
 Aortic Dissection
 Sympathomimetic Overdose

Medical Protocols - Adult
P
Nitroglycerin Paste (If Available)
 SBP >100, 1 inch of paste
 SBP >150, 1.5 inches of paste
 SBP >200, 2 inches of paste
Note: For SBP >200, NTG Paste will likely
not have a significant impact on BP;
consider SL NTG
