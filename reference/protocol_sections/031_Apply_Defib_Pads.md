ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction - Adult
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, RR, Lung Sounds, Cardiac Exam, JVD
 Goal is First Medical Contact (YOU!!) to arrival at the 24/7 PCI capable STEMI facility should be <60 minutes.
 Goal is to limit on-scene time with a STEMI patient to <10 minutes.
 NTG goal is 20% reduction in SBP or symptom relief. If patient reports no relief with home Nitroglycerin, consider potency of medication (is the medicine expired? Would
EMS supply be useful?).
 If long transport time expected due to geography, traffic, etc. consider activation of Air EMS for delivery directly to cath lab.
 Transmit STEMI or **Acute MI** 12-Leads early and call STEMI receiving hospital with “STEMI Alert” early; inform them of full report to follow.
Medical Protocols - Adult
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, SpO2, EtCO2, RR
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 CHF, CAD, Chest Pain History
Differential
 Pericardial Tamponade
 Pericarditis
 Asthma / COPD
 Aortic Dissection
 Home meds prior to EMS Arrival
(Warfarin, Anticoagulation, ASA,
Viagra, Cialis)
 Respiratory Distress
 Orthopnea, JVD
 Sympathomimetic Overdose
 Pulmonary Embolism

Nitroglycerin Paste (If Available)
 SBP >100, 1 inch of paste
 SBP >150, 1.5 inches of paste
 SBP >200, 2 inches of paste
Note: For SBP >200, NTG Paste will
likely not have a significant impact on
BP; consider SL NTG
