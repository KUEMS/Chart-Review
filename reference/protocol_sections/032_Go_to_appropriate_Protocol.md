Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, RR, Lung Sounds, Cardiac Exam, JVD
 *Unstable – Severe Hypotension, Signs of Shock, AMS Secondary to Arrhythmia.
 Not all cases of tachycardia need to be rate controlled; sepsis, hypovolemia, and acute hemorrhage will do worse if their ability to compensate is taken away
 Adenosine has a very short half life (5sec or less) so it must be infused rapidly in a patent IV site, preferably the AC fossa or more proximal
