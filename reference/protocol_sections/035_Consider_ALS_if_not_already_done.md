Allergic Reaction - Adult
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Skin, Cardiovascular, Pulmonary
 Epinephrine Infusion: Mix 1mg (1:1,000) in 250mL NS. If worsening/refractory anaphylaxis, contact Med Control as soon as practical. Start at 2mcg/min, titrate up.
 Famotidine dilution no longer required. Infuse over 2 minutes.
 In general, the shorter the time from allergen contact to start of symptoms, the more severe the reaction.
 Consider the Airway Management Protocol early in patients with Severe Allergic Reaction or subjective throat closing.
