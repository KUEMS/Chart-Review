Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Skin, Cardiovascular, Pulmonary
 Safety First – For Providers, Police and Patients! Never restrain any patients in the prone (face down) position.
 Physical and/or chemical restraints should ONLY be used if patient is deemed a danger to themselves or others and is uncooperative and less invasive measures to
deescalate have failed or were deemed unsafe to attempt.
 All patients who require chemical restraint MUST be continuously monitored by ALS Personnel.
 Patients who are actively fighting physical restraints are at high risk for Behavioral Emergencies and In-Custody Death; Have a low threshold to activate ALS for chemical
restraint.
 There are multiple possible causes of behavioral emergencies. Keep a broad differential when evaluating and treating these patients.
 Transport of patients requiring handcuffs or Law Enforcement (LE) restraint require LE to ride in the ambulance to the hospital – they have the keys!
 *Avoid Haloperidol in patients with known history of MAOI Antidepressant use (Phenelzine, Tranylcypromine) OR history of Parkinson’s Disease.
 If a patient with severe agitation suddenly becomes cooperative/quiet, reassess them quickly! Sudden Cardiac Death is common in this population.
