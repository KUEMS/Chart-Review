Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, SpO2, Blood Glucose, Skin, Respiratory Rate and Effort, Neuro Exam
 Do NOT administer oral glucose to patients that can’t swallow or adequately protect their airway.
 Simple Hypoglycemia for these protocols is defined as: hypoglycemia caused by insulin ONLY and not suspected to be due to occult infection or trauma.
 Prolonged hypoglycemia may not respond to Glucagon; be prepared to start an IV and administer IV Dextrose.
 Alcoholics and patients with advanced liver disease may not respond to Glucagon due to poor liver glycogen stores.
 Patients on oral diabetes medications are at a very high risk of recurrent hypoglycemia and should be transported. Contact Medical Control for advice/patient counseling if
patient is refusing. See Refusal after Hypoglycemia Treatment Protocol for additional information as necessary.
 Always consider intentional insulin overdose, and ask patients / family / friends / witnesses about suicidal ideation or gestures.
