IV Access - Adult
Pearls
 In the setting of CARDIAC ARREST ONLY, any preexisting dialysis shunt or central line may be used by Paramedics
 For patients who are hemodynamically unstable or in extremis, Medical Control MUST be contacted prior to accessing any preexisting catheters
 Upper Extremity sites are preferred over Lower Extremity sites. Lower Extremity IVs are discouraged in patients with peripheral vascular disease or diabetes
 In post-mastectomy patients and patients with forearm dialysis fistulas, avoid IV attempts, blood draws, injections or blood pressures in the upper extremity on the affected
side
 Saline Locks are acceptable in cases where access may be necessary but the patient is not volume depleted; having an IV does not mandate IV Fluid infusion
 The preferred order of IV Access is: Peripheral IV, External Jugular IV, Intraosseous IV UNLESS medical acuity or situation dictate otherwise.
