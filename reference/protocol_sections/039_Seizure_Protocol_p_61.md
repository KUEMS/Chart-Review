Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Mental Status, Neuro, Abdominal Exam, Cardiovascular
 Magnesium is the priority for pregnant seizures (eclampsia), but if seizing on EMS arrival give IM/IN Midazolam until IV Access achieved.
 Continuous monitoring is required, as magnesium may cause hypotension and decreased respiratory drive.
 Hypertension, Severe headache, vision changes, RUQ pain, diffuse edema may indicate preeclampsia. This may progress to seizures (eclampsia).
 Any pregnant patient involved in an MVC or other trauma should be evaluated by MD for evaluation and fetal monitoring.
