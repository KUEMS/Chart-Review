Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Mental Status, Neuro, Abdominal Exam, Cardiovascular
 Most Newborns requiring resuscitation will respond to supplemental O2, BVMs, airway clearing maneuvers. If not, go to Neonatal Resuscitation Protocol
 Consider birth trauma during evaluation of non-vigorous Newborn; pneumothorax, hypovolemia, hypoglycemia
 Term gestation, strong cry / adequate respirations with good tone will generally need no resuscitation
 Expected Pulse Ox Readings: Birth – 1min = 60-65%, 1-2min = 65-70%, 3-4min = 70-75%, 4-5min = 75-80%, 5-10min = 80-85%, >10min = >90%
 APGAR scores at 1min and 5 min. Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respirations. Each score gets 0, 1 or 2 points (Total 10). If either in the moderately depressed range,
continue to record and document every 5 minutes.
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, SpO2, EtCO2, RR
 SAMPLE history
 OPQRST history
 Pregnancy History (G’s and P’s)
 Estimated Due Date
Differential
 Maternal Medication Effect
 Hypovolemia
 Pneumothorax
 Hypoglycemia
 Congenital Heart Defect
 Maternal / Newborn Infection /
Sepsis
 Airway Obstruction – Secretions
 Choanal Atresia (imperforate
nares)
 Prenatal Care / High Risk
Pregnancy
 Time of Contraction Onset,
Frequency
 Rupture of Membranes and Time
 Sensation of Fetal Movement
