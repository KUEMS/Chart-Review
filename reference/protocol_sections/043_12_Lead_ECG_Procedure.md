Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Mental Status, Skin, Blood Glucose
 Resuscitate first, hemodynamically unstable patients are high risk for cardiac arrest.
 Be suspicious of scenes where multiple people and/or animals appear to be affected.
 In opioid overdose – poor respiratory efforts is what kills patients, emphasis should be on ventilation support FIRST and naloxone administration second.
 Patients are unreliable historians in overdose situations, particularly in suicide attempts. Trust what they tell you, but verify (pill bottles, circumstances, etc.).
 Critical Scene Information: Time of Ingestion, Number and Type of meds ingested, Seizure or mental status changes; Please consider bringing pill bottles, contents, emesis and
reliable contact info to the ED; this will be important in patient evaluation and assessment.
 Be careful of off-gassing in cases of inhalation of volatile agents.
 Many intentional overdoses involve multiple substances, some with cardiac toxicity; a 12-Lead ECG should be obtained on all overdoses situation permitting.
 If smoke exposure consider carbon monoxide/Cyanide protocol p63.
 Consider Cyanide when exposed to any products of combustion, mining incidents or industrial organic chemistry exposure.
