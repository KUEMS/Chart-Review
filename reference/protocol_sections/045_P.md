 *Each DuoDote Kit contains 600mg 2-PAM and 2.1mg of Atropine. The kits in the ambulance are intended for responder use only. If/When the emergency cache has been
released by the State of Wisconsin, those kits may be used for the general public.
 SLUDGEM – Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination (Incontinence), Defecation (Incontinence), GI Upset, Emesis, Miosis.
 For patients with major symptoms, there is no max dosing for Atropine; continue administering until salivation/secretions improved.
 Follow all Hazmat procedures, strictly adhere to personal protective equipment for exposure prevention and begin decontamination early.
 Patients who have been exposed to organophosphates are highly likely to off-gas; be sure to use all responder PPE and to avoid exposure to clothing or exhalations of victims.
Helicopter EMS is generally NOT appropriate for these patients.
 A cholinergic crisis is an over-stimulation at a neuromuscular junction due to an excess of acetylcholine (ACh), as of a result of the inactivity or inhibition of the AChE enzyme,
which normally breaks down acetylcholine.
