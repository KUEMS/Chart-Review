Carbon Monoxide Poisoning - Adult
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Mental Status, Neuro, Abdominal Exam, Cardiovascular
 Fetal hemoglobin has a stronger affinity for CO than adult, and will preferentially take the CO from the Mother, giving her a FALSE LOW SpCO level.
 Hospital evaluation should be strongly encouraged for any pregnant or suspected to be pregnant females; all hospitals should have access to Rad-57 device.
 The absence or low levels of SpCO is not a reliable predictor of firefighter/victim exposures to other toxic byproducts of combustion. Consider the Cyanide Poisoning Protocol.
 Multiple patients presenting with vague, influenza-like symptoms simultaneously should raise your suspicion of CO exposure. Ask about home heating methods, generator
use, exposure to combustible fuels.
Pertinent Positives/Negatives:
 Age, VS, SpO2, EtCO2, RR
 SAMPLE history
 OPQRST history
 Known or suspected CO Exposure
 Source and Duration of Exposure
 Dysrhythmias
Differential
 Acute Myocardial Infarction
 Hypoglycemia
 Diabetic Ketoacidosis
 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
 Acute Stroke
 Influenza
 Other toxic
inhalation
 Tension Headache
 Headache, Nausea/Vomiting
 Chest Pain, Arrhythmias
 Respiratory Distress
 Seizures
 Mental Status Change
 Vomiting
