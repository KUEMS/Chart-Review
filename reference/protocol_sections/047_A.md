Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Vital Signs, GCS, Neuro Exam, Lung Sounds, Abdominal Exam, Musculoskeletal Exam, Area of Pain
 Provider discretion to be used for patients suffering from chronic pain related issues. However, please note that history of chronic pain does not preclude
the patient from treatment of acute pain related etiologies.
 Pain severity (0-10) is a vital sign to be recorded pre- and post-medication delivery and at disposition.
 As with all medical interventions, assess and document change in patient condition pre- and post-treatment.
 Opiate naive patients and the elderly can have a dramatic response to analgesic medications; start low and titrate up as appropriate.
 Allow for position of maximum comfort as situation allows.
 Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen if no contraindications may be considered for analgesic benefit in the setting of fever.
 **Ketorolac is contraindicated in: Pregnancy, anticoagulation or bleeding diatheses, anticipated surgery, NSAID use (including EMS administered
ibuprofen), GI bleeding, possible intracranial hemorrhage, renal disease. Extreme caution in females of reproductive age (hospitals will not give to
patients without a negative pregnancy test), elderly patients, and potential renal insufficiency.
 *Oral medications are contraindicated in anyone who may need an emergent surgery or procedure; “if in doubt, don’t give PO”.
