REQUIRED EXAM: Blood Sugar, SpO2, GCS, Neuro Exam
 Midazolam is effective in terminating seizures. Do not delay IM/IN administration to obtain IV access in an actively seizing patient.
 Do not hesitate to treat recurrent, prolonged (>1 minute) seizure activity.
 Status epilepticus is >2 successive seizures without recovery or consciousness in between. These patients require airway management and rapid transport.
 Assess for possibility of occult trauma, substance abuse.
 Active seizure in known or suspected pregnancy >20 weeks, give Magnesium 4gm IV/IO over 10 minutes.
