Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, SpO2, Blood Glucose, Neuro Exam, Cincinnati Stroke Scale
 SIRS: The body’s inflammatory response to an insult that results in the activation of the immune response
 Sepsis: SIRS + documented or highly suspected infection
 Severe Sepsis: Sepsis + sepsis induced organ dysfunction
 Septic Shock: Sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation resulting in tissue hypoperfusion
 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC): An international initiative to reduce mortality in patients with sepsis. Mortality with severe sepsis is 30-50%, and
increases to 60% when shock is present. There are 750,000 new cases and 210,000 US fatalities are attributed to sepsis annually.
 The importance of early identification of sepsis and prompt appropriate treatment cannot be understated; EMS is the critical first link!
 Fluid resuscitation, pressors and EARLY antibiotics are the things that save lives in sepsis.
