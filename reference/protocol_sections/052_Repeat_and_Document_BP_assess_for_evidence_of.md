Repeat and Document BP, assess for evidence of
adequate perfusion
A
Consider IVF bolus IV/IO, repeat as indicated
for patient condition
CAUTION in CHF/volume overload
P
Norepinephrine infusion IF Available
Start 4-16mcg/min IV/IO
Titrate to SBP >100, MAP >65, or signs of
improved perfusion
OR
Epinephrine (1:10,000) infusion
Start 2-10mcg/min IV/IO
Etiologies & Considerations
Hypovolemic
(Dehydration, GI Bleed)
Distributive
(Sepsis, Anaphylaxis)
Blood Glucose

Blood Glucose
Acute Adrenal Insufficiency
State where the body cannot produce
enough steroids. Primary adrenal disease
vs. recent discontinuation of steroids
(Prednisone) after long term use.

Hypotension / Shock (Non-Trauma) - Adult
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, BP, RR, SpO2
 SAMPLE history
 OPQRST history
 Source of blood loss, if any (GI, vaginal, AAA, ectopic)
 Source of fluid loss, if any (vomiting, diarrhea, fever)
 Pregnancy history
Differential
 Cardiac Dysrhythmia
 Hypoglycemia
 Ectopic Pregnancy
 AAA
 Sepsis
 Occult Trauma
 Adrenal Insufficiency
 Mental Status
 Pale, Cool Skin
 Delayed Cap Refill
 Coffee Ground Emesis
 Tarry Stools
 Allergen Exposure

Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, RR, Lung sounds, JVD
 Shock may present with normal VS and progress insidiously; Tachycardia may be the first and only sign of shock.
 *Patients receiving a fluid bolus should be continuously re-evaluated for signs of fluid overload. This is especially true for patients with suspected obstructive or
cardiogenic etiologies of shock.
 If evidence or suspicion of trauma, move to Hemorrhage Protocol early.
 Document respiratory rate, SpO2 and breath sounds with IV Fluids, and consider Pulmonary Edema Protocol as appropriate.

P
If suspected imminent arrest,
Consider push dose Epi 5-20mcg p190
every 1-2 minutes SBP>100, MAP >65, or signs
of improved perfusion
