Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, SpO2, Blood Glucose, Neuro Exam, BE-FAST Stroke Scale
 In Stroke, BE-FAST – Sudden onset of Balance loss or incoordination, Eyes/vision changes, Facial Asymmetry, Arm Strength, Speech difficulty or Terrible
headache.
 Be very diligent observing for airway compromise in suspected acute stroke (swallowing, vomiting, aspirating).
 Consider Elevate Head of Stretcher 15-30 degrees.
 Hypoglycemia, Infection and Hypoxia can present with Neurologic deficit, especially in the elderly.
 IV Access is important, but establishment of a line should not significantly delay initiation of transport. Time lost is brain lost!
 Pre-notification to the receiving hospital is critical to ensure timely brain imaging, administration of thrombolytics and thrombectomy procedures.
 When calling in last known well time, identify actual time vs. duration of symptoms.
Pertinent Positive/Negative:
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 History of CVA, TIA
 Previous Cardiac, Vascular Surgery
 Anticoagulant Use
Differential
 TIA
 Seizure
 Hypoglycemia
 Tumor
 Occult Trauma
 Stroke
-Ischemic (~85%)
-Hemorrhagic (~15%)
 Weakness / Paralysis
 Aphasia / Dysarthria
 Headache
 Vertigo
 Seizure
