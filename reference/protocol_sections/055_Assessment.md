General Approach – Adult, Trauma
Differential
 Stroke
 STEMI
 Overdose
 Elder Abuse
 Domestic Violence
 Non-Accidental Trauma
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, GCS
 Time of Injury, Mechanism of Injury
 DCAP-BTLS
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Pain / Swelling
 Mental Status
 Hypotension / Shock
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Vital Signs, GCS, Loss of Consciousness, Location of Pain (then targeted per Appropriate Trauma Protocol)
 If presentation is not consistent with traumatic mechanism consider potential medical etiologies.
 Trauma Destination for patients <18 - Pediatric Destination Determination Protocol p113
 Assess for major trauma criteria immediately upon patient contact
-RR <10 or >29; SBP <90; Pulse <50 or >140; GCS <13; SpO2<93%
-Transport to Trauma Center, minimize scene time to goal of <10 minutes
 Disability – assess for neuro deficits including paralysis, weakness, abnormal sensation
 Suspect Tension Pneumothorax when:
-Mechanism consistent with Chest Trauma; Resp Distress; Decreased Breath Sounds; JVD; Low BP; Tachycardia; Tracheal Deviation
-Signs and Symptoms of Tension Pneumothorax may be present with or without positive pressure ventilations
-Needle Decompression should be performed with a 3" 14ga needle at the 2
nd intercostal space, midclavicular line
-If repeat decompression necessary, continue to move laterally along the superior aspect of the 3
rd rib
