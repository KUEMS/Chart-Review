 Burns to face and eyes, remove contact lenses prior to irrigation.
 Chemical burns require removal of contaminated clothing, brush away dry powder before irrigation. Flush with copious warm water on scene and continue irrigation en
route. Be sure to brush excess away and remove contaminated clothing BEFORE beginning irrigation. Early intubation is strongly recommended if suspicion of inhalation

edema, hoarseness, singed nasal hairs, agitation, hypoxia or cyanosis.
 Indications of possible Cyanide Poisoning - Exposure to fumes from burning Nitrile (polyurethane, vinyl) Seizures, coma, cardiac arrest, headache, vertigo and/or cherry red
