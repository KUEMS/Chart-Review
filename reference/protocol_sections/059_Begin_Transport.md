Traumatic Cardiac Arrest – Adult, Trauma
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Pupillary Light Reflex, Palpation of Pulses, Heart and Lung Auscultation
 Special consideration for patients – hanging, suspected hypothermia, drowning, or lightning strikes follow medical cardiac arrest protocol and consider
early OLMC consultation.
 Injuries incompatible with life include; decapitation, incineration, massively deforming head or chest injury, or obvious signs of death (p15)
 Consider using medical cardiac arrest protocols if uncertainty exists regarding etiology of arrest
 Use of a long spine board will make chest compressions more effective; however, if spinal immobilization interferes with CPR use reasonable effort to limit
patient and spine movement
 Be aware that these may be crime scenes: do your best to avoid disturbing forensic evidence
 If provider safety becomes a concern, transport of deceased patients to the hospital is acceptable
 Pregnancy EDC can be estimated by palpating the gravid uterus; above the level of the umbilicus is generally >22 weeks
Trauma Protocols - Adult
Potential Medical cause of arrest?
(including hanging, suspected hypothermia, drowning,
or lightning strikes)
No
Go To Cardiac Arrest Adult Protocol
p37
No
ACLS meds and CPR are less effective in
traumatic arrests and priority should be on
treating reversible causes
Asystole or PEA <40?
Do not attempt resuscitation.

Isolated Penetrating Blunt or
Multisystem injuries
Rapid transport to nearest I/II
trauma center
Follow Post-ROSC protocol and
contact OLMC as needed
Yes
Isolated Penetrating Injuries to the Thorax/Abdomen
Does the patient meet all three criteria?
1. EMS Witnessed Arrest
2. Isolated penetrating injury to the thorax/abdomen
3. Transport time to Level I/II less than 15 min.
No
Yes
No
Continue Resuscitation During Transport.
Follow Post-ROSC protocol if pulses are restored.
