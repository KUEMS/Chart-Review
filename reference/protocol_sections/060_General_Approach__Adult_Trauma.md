Chemical / Electrical Burn – Adult, Trauma
Differential
 Thermal Injury
 Chemical Burn
 Electrical Injury
 Blast Injury
 Abrasion
 Contusion
 Laceration
 Compartment Syndrome
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Type of exposure (heat, gas, chemical)
 Central and Peripheral Pulses
 Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea
 Chemical Name (if known)
 Time of Exposure (duration)
 Mechanism of secondary injury
(blunt vs. penetrating)
 Voltage of Electrical Current (if
known)
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 Provider Safety is paramount! Ensure Chemical Source is not a hazard to responders and Electrical Sources are not contacting patient prior to assessment.
Don’t allow yourself or your crew to become victims.
 Safety First! Assure a Chemical source of burn is NOT a hazard to responders. Assure an Electrical source of burn is OFF or no longer contacting pt.
 High Voltage Electrical Burns (>600 volts) require spinal immobilization, continuous cardiac monitor and IV access regardless of external appearance of
injury
 Chemical burns require removal of contaminated clothing, brush away dry powder before irrigation. Flush with copious warm water on scene and
continue irrigation en route. Be sure to brush excess away and remove contaminated clothing BEFORE beginning irrigation
 Superficial appearance of Electrical Burns does NOT indicate severity of underlying tissue damage
 Attempt to locate contact points in Electrical Burns, generally contact point with source and where patient is grounded. Do not refer to them as entry or
exit wounds. Surface appearance may belie the damage below
 Electrical Burns cause ventricular and atrial irritability and dysrhythmias; anticipate cardiac problems and treat accordingly
