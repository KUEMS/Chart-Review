Chest Injury – Adult, Trauma
Differential
 Simple Pneumothorax
 Tension Pneumothorax
 Pericardial Tamponade
 Aortic Root Disruption
 Bronchial Tree Injury
 Tracheal Disruption
 Great Vessel Laceration
 Cardiac Contusion
 Cardiac Laceration
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Type of injury
 Mechanism (blunt vs. penetrating)
 Respiratory Effort, Adequacy
 Abnormal Breath Sounds (unilateral vs. bilateral)
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Evidence of Intoxication
 Evidence of Multi-System
Trauma
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 Consider tension pneumothorax in any patient with penetrating chest trauma, OR blunt chest trauma with decreased unilateral breath sounds,
hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, tracheal deviation (late) or JVD (late)
 Aortic root injuries, bronchial disruption and tracheal disruptions are common with major deceleration injuries (i.e. MVC)
 Cardiac contusions are common with blunt chest trauma, and may present with ectopy, PVCs or even STEMI appearance on cardiac monitor
 Pericardial Tamponade is a surgical emergency and needs rapid transport. Look for muffled heart tones, hypotension, tachycardia
