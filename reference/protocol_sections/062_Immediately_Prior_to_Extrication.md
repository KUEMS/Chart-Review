Management of Crush Injury Patient
Crush Injury should be suspected in prolonged
pinnings >1 hour, AND proximal to the knee or
elbow.

Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Vital Signs, GCS, Lung Sounds, Neuro Exam, Musculoskeletal Exam
 Structural Collapse, Crush Scenes are often full of hazards, provider safety is the most important consideration
 Patients may become hypothermic, even in warm environments
-Hypothermia can lead to coagulopathy, which will increase bleeding times and have worse outcomes for the patient
 Crush injuries can result in hyperkalemia from shift of Potassium out of injured cells. Cardiac monitoring is required and 12-lead ECG preferred whenever
possible (as dicated by the situation)
 Monitor extremities for signs of compartment syndrome after crush injury; Pain, Pallor, Paresthesias, Paralysis, Pulselessness and Poikilothermia (inability
to regulate core body temperature)
 *Utilize different IV lines or flush between bicarb and calcium to prevent precipitation in the line
