Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 Have a HIGH index of suspicion for possible spinal injuries. Any diving injury or submersion with unclear details should be fully immobilized.
 Hypothermia is often associated with near-drowning and submersion injuries. Consider the Hypothermia Protocol as appropriate.
 All patients with Near-Drowning / Submersion Injury should be transported for evaluation due to delayed presentation of respiratory failure.
 With diving injuries (decompression / barotrauma) consider availability of a hyperbaric chamber; contact Medical Control early.
 Near-drowning patients who are awake and cooperative but with respiratory distress may benefit from CPAP / Positive Pressure Ventilation.
