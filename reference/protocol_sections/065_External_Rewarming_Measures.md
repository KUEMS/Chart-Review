External Rewarming Measures
12-Lead ECG Procedure
p129
Environmental, Hypothermia – Adult, Trauma
General Approach – Adult, Trauma
Remove Patient from Cold Environment
(if applicable)
Remove Wet Clothing
Dry and Warm the Patient
Blood Glucose Procedure

Estimate
Severity of
Symptoms
Mild Hypothermia
90-95oF (32-35oC)
Moderate Hypothermia
82-90oF (28-32oC)
Severe Hypothermia
<82oF (<28oC)
Localized Cold Injury Only
(Frostbite)
Sympathetic Nervous System Excitation –
Shivering, Hypertension, Tachycardia,
Tachypnea
Awake But May Be Confused
Shivering more violent, ataxia and
incoordination apparent.
Stumbling pace and Moderate Confusion
Appears pale as surface vessels constrict to
retain heat.
Heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate
decrease.
Disoriented, confused and combative
Paradoxically may discard clothing
No

Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, Mental Status
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Time and length of exposure to cold environment
Differential
 Alcohol Intoxication
 Hypothyroidism (Myxedema Coma)
 Dehydration
 Sepsis
 CNS Lesion or Head Injury
 Abuse or Neglect (Elderly or
disabled)
 Medication (beta blocker
overdose, opiate overdose)
 Cold or clammy skin
 Confusion
 Arrhythmias, J-waves on
ECG
 Hypotension, Shock

Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Skin, HEENT, Neuro, Evidence of Intoxication, Mental Status
 Hypoglycemia is found in many hypothermic patients, because hypothermia may be a result of hypoglycemia
 Severe hypothermia may cause myocardial irritability and rough handling can theoretically cause V-fib. Please handle carefully.
-Do not withhold intubation or CPR for this concern, but only the most experienced provider available should gently attempt intubation
 Below 86oF (30oC), antiarrhythmics may not be effective. If given, they should be given at reduced intervals. Do NOT attempt to pace below 86oF. If
antiarrhythmics necessary for severely hypothermic patient, Contact Medical Control
 Extremes of age, malnutrition, EtOH and drug abuse and outdoor hobbies / employment all predispose to hypothermia
