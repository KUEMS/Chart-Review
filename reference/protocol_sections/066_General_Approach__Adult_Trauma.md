Extremity Injury – Adult, Trauma
Differential
 Vascular Disruption
 Amputation
 Fracture, Dislocation
 Sprain, Strain
 Abrasion
 Contusion
 Laceration
 Compartment Syndrome
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Type of injury
 Mechanism (blunt vs. penetrating)
 Central and Peripheral Pulses
 Neuro Function Distal to Injury
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Evidence of Intoxication
 Evidence of Multi-System
Trauma
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 Immobilization of bony injuries should include the joint above and below. Joint injuries require immobilization of bone above and below
 Palpate and document Circulation, Movement and Sensation both before and after splint application
 Tourniquets should remain in place once hemorrhage control is adequate. The tourniquet is tight enough when the bleeding stops!
 If active hemorrhage and bony/soft tissue deformity, priority should be put on hemorrhage control first, then splinting – remember A,B,C’s
 If amputated extremities available, seal in a plastic bag and place in cool water and bring to the hospital with the patient
