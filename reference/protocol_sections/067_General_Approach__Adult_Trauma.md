Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Visual Acuity, Neuro Exam, Extraocular Movements
 Stabilize any penetrating objects. DO NOT remove any embedded / impaled objects
 If Long Spine Board not indicated, transport with head of stretcher elevated to 60 degrees to help reduce intraocular pressure
 Remove contact lenses when possible
 Always cover both eyes to prevent further injury
 Orbital fractures increase concern for globe or optic nerve injury; follow visual acuity and extraocular movements for changes
 Normal visual acuity can be present, even with severe injury
