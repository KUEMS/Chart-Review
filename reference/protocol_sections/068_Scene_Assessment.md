Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Skin, HEENT, Neuro, Evidence of Intoxication, Mental Status
 The most important factor in Hazmat response is provider safety – you can’t help anyone else if you’re a victim as well
 In any Hazmat situation, consider that the exposure may not be accidental; consider intentional releases, secondary devices and terrorism
 Always park upwind and uphill of any potential exposures, and be conscious of any symptoms you may begin to develop
 Communication is key; contact the appropriate Hazmat authority early and notify the Hazmat leader as well as the Comm Center of findings
 In a large-scale event, have the Comm Center activate Dane County Mass Casualty Plan and notify the Base Hospital to get prepared
 Inhaled bicarb is controversial but seems to help. Aslan S, Kandis H, Akgun M, Cakir Z, Inandi T, Görgüner M. The effect of nebulized NaHCO3 treatment on
"RADS" due to chlorine gas inhalation. Inhal Toxicol. 2006 Oct. 18(11):895-900.
