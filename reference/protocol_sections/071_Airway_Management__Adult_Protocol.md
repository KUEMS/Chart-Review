Lightning Strike Patient Management
Typically, victims of lightning strikes who do not suffer
cardiac or respiratory arrest survive; typical triage protocols
do not apply under these circumstances, and resuscitation
should be provided to those who are PNB first.
ECG evidence of direct myocardial damage from lightning
strike includes ST segment elevation, T-wave inversion and
prolongation of the QT interval.
Most injuries occur outdoors, but contact with plumbing,
phone lines, etc. that are struck can injure people indoors.

 National lightning safety guidelines state that risk continues for 30 minutes after the last lightning is seen or thunder heard.
 Lightning not striking twice is a myth; if there is continued risk to EMS providers, remove the patient to a safe place before treatment.
 Full spinal immobilization should be performed in any patient with altered level of consciousness, as spinal injuries are common from the concussive force
of the strike and/or involuntary muscle spasms.
 There are reports of patients surviving prolonged periods of arrest after lightning strike. Treatment for cardiopulmonary arrest is per ACLS protocols, but
decision to terminate resuscitation should be made in coordination with Medical Control.
