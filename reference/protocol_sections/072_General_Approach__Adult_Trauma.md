or Axilla
Removed by Law Enforcement prior to
EMS Evaluation
The Thomas A. Swift Electric Rifle (TASER)
The TASER fires two small dart-like electrodes,
which stay connected to the main unit by
conductive wire as they are propelled by small
compressed nitrogen charges
Scene Safe
Yes
Refer to Police Custody Policy, As
Appropriate p27
Notify Receiving Facility,
Contact Medical Control As
Necessary
No
Stage,
Call for Law Enforcement AND/OR
Additional Resources
Evidence of
Exposure /
Toxidrome
Begin Triage and Decontamination,
As Appropriate Yes
Go To Appropriate Cardiac
Dysrhythmia, Adult Medical Protocol No Yes
DO NOT REMOVE ELECTRODES
Stabilize in Place and Transport
Place one hand flat on the patient
around the probe and stabilize the skin
surrounding the puncture site. Place
your other hand/pliers firmly around
the base of the probe
In one fluid motion pull the probe
straight out from the puncture site
Repeat procedure with second probe
Examine Site for Bleeding, Expanding
Hematoma or Distal Neuro Deficit
Arrhythmia on
Monitor
Examine Site for Bleeding, Expanding
Hematoma or Distal Neuro Deficit

Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 Safety first – for Providers, Police and Patients. Never restrain any patients in the prone (face down) position.
 Document the site of electrode penetration as well as whether the barb was completely intact or broken on removal.
 Patients who require repeated deployments of the Electronic Control Device are at a significantly higher risk of cardiac dysrhythmias as well as in-custody
death. Have a high index of suspicion and a low threshold to treat per the Behavioral Emergencies Protocol .
 Patients who are actively restrained by Law Enforcement require an officer be present in the ambulance patient compartment during transport. It is a
patient safety issue as well as a medicolegal liability for the EMS Provider.
