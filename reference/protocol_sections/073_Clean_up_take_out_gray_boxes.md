Selective Spinal Motion Restriction – Adult, Trauma
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Motor Function both upper and lower extremities, Sensation of upper and lower extremities, subjective abnormal sensation, Tenderness to palpation of bony
prominences OR paraspinal muscles
 *Clinical Intoxication – A transient condition resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological
functions and responses. Common examples include; ataxia, emotional instability, flight of ideas, tangential thought or motor incoordination.
 **Distracting Injury – Examples include, but are not limited to; long bone fracture, dislocations, large lacerations, deforming injuries, burns OR any condition preventing
patient cooperation with history.
 ALL shallow water near drownings, diving injuries and high-voltage electrical injuries (lightning, ≥1000V AC or ≥1500V DC) MUST be fully immobilized
 If immobilization indicated but refused; advise the patient of risk of death, permanent disability or long term impairment. Clearly document the refusal and the conversation
(re: risk); Apply a cervical collar, if allowed and transport in neutral alignment.
 Long spine boards have risks and benefits for patients. Spinal immobilization should always be applied when any doubt exists about the possibility of spinal trauma.
 It is always safer and better patient care to assume that a Cervical Spine injury has occurred and provide protection, and should be the standard of care in trauma patient
management
 Long spine boards can be very useful for extricating patients, transferring locations, and providing a firm surface for chest compressions.
 Very thoughtful consideration should go into any decision to NOT use the rigid cervical collar OR long spine board.
