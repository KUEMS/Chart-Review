IV Access Protocol
p49
A
Consider IVF Bolus IV/IO, Repeat as
indicated for patient condition, consider
permissive hypotension in setting of
ongoing serious hemorrhage
P
Consider TXA 2 gm of TXA via slow
IV or IO push over 1 min.
General Approach – Adult, Trauma
Consider Hemorrhage Control,
Adult Trauma p81

Hypotension / Shock (Trauma) – Adult, Trauma
Differential
 Vascular Disruption
 Amputation
 Fracture, Dislocation
 Sprain, Strain
 Abrasion
 Contusion
 Laceration
 Compartment Syndrome
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Type of injury
 Mechanism (blunt vs. penetrating)
 Central and Peripheral Pulses
 Neuro Function Distal to Injury
 Time of Injury
 Deformity
 Diminished pulse / capillary
refill
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 Hypotension in trauma needs blood products early, so minimize scene time. Goal for scene time in major trauma cases should be <10 min.
 Remember the Triad of Death in Trauma – Hypotension, Hypothermia and Coagulopathy; IVF are important during resuscitation, but it is important to
remember how fluids impact these three elements.
 Multiple casualty incident or obvious life threatening hemorrhage, consider Tourniquet Procedure and/or Hemostatic Dressing FIRST.
 Hemostatic Dressings are appropriate for hemorrhage that can’t be controlled with a tourniquet, such as abdominal and pelvic wounds.
 Signs/Symptoms of Shock include: altered mental status, pallor, hypotension (SBP <100), cap refill >3 sec, faint/absent peripheral pulses.
Trauma Protocols - Adult
P
Consider Norepinephrine 4-16 mcg/min
IV/IO Titrate to SBP >100, MAP >65, or
signs of improved perfusion
B EMT
A A-EMT
P Paramedic
M Medical Control
EMR
P
Consider push dose Epi 5-20mcg every 1-
2 minutes SBP>100, MAP >65, or signs of
improved perfusion
