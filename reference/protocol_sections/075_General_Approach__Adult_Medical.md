Public Safety Personnel Rehab – Special Operations
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, Skin Condition, Temperature, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure, SpO2, SpCO
 This Protocol was named “Public Safety Rehab”, and should be applied to any situation during which Firefighters, Law Enforcement Officers, Emergency Medical Services or
ANY Emergency Response Personnel are exerting themselves for > 40 minutes.
o This INCLUDES training operations, special events and non-emergency operations lasting longer than 40 minutes.
 Per NFPA 1584 Requirements, the Rehab Site should be set up in a location that provides shelter for the members, is far enough away from the active scene that the turnout
gear, SCBA and protective equipment may be safety doffed, and provide protection from the environmental conditions.
o Ideally, members should be shielded from view of the active scene, to reduce anxiety and to prevent members from trying to exit rehab inappropriately.
 The purpose of this Protocol is to protect the physical and mental condition of members operating at the scene of an emergency or a training exercise and to prevent
decompensation of the individual. By keeping the individuals safe, it improves the safety and integrity of the team as well as the operation.
 At a minimum, turnout coat and nomex hood should be removed and turnout pants pushed down to the knees while seated in Rehab.
