Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Nature of Complaint
 Continuous Cardiac Monitor should be applied early for any non-traumatic pain complaint between the ear lobes and the umbilicus (belly button). Consider 12-Lead if
concerning findings on Cardiac Monitor.
 Include Blood Glucose reading for any patient with weakness, altered mental status, seizure, loss of consciousness or known history of diabetes.
 Measure and document SpO2, EtCO2 for ANY patient with complaint of weakness, altered mental status, respiratory distress, respiratory failure or EMS managed airway.
 If hypotensive (Systolic BP<Reference Page Value) and/or clinical evidence of dehydration, consider Peds IV Access Protocol and Shock (Non-Trauma) Peds Medical Protocol.
 Any patient contact which does not result in an EMS transport must have an appropriately executed and completed refusal form.
 Never hesitate to consult Medical Control for assistance with patient refusals that can’t meet all required fields, clarification of protocols or for patients that make you
uncomfortable.
