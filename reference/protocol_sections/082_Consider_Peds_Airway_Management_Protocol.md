Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, 12 Lead, GCS, RR, Lung Sounds, Accessory muscle use, nasal flaring
 Do not delay inhaled meds to get an extended history. Assessments and interviews may be carried out simultaneously with breathing treatments.
 Supplemental O2 should be administered for all cases of hypoxia, tachypnea, and subjective air hunger.
 Magnesium Sulfate is contraindicated if there is a history of renal failure.
 Keep patient in position of comfort if partial obstruction.
 EpiPen Jr. is 0.15mg and is indicated for patients <60lbs. The adult EpiPen is 0.30mg and is indicated for patients >60lbs.
 Severe Asthma attacks may have such severe obstruction that they do NOT wheeze. Cases of “Silent Chest” need aggressive management with inhaled and IV medications.
This is an ominous sign of impending respiratory failure.
 * Albuterol max 3 doses total, Ipratropium max 2 doses total. If pt. requires repeat dosing of either medication, contact Med Control AND/OR Activate ALS.
