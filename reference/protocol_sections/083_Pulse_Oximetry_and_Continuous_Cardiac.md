Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Skin, Cardivascular, Pulmonary
 Call early for ALS Intercept on neonates who are critically ill, and involve Medical Control so arrangements can be made at the receiving facility.
 Transport rapidly to an OB Receiving Facility.
 Consider hypoglycemia as etiology of neonatal arrest/peri-arrest situation. If not able to evaluate blood sugar, treat presumptively x 1.
 The increased concentration of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and its increased affinity for oxygen is a factor to consider in establishing target SpO2 values in the neonate. HbF will
shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the left due to its high affinity for oxygen, which may result in high oxygen saturation (eg, 85 percent) at PaO2 levels below 40 mmHg.
 Per AHA Naloxone is not recommended in initial resuscitation of newborns.
