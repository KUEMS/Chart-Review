# Section 85: CONSIDER CORRECTABLE CAUSES:

---

CONSIDER CORRECTABLE CAUSES:
Hypoxia – Secure airway and ventilate
Hypothermia – Active Rewarming
Hydrogen Ion (acidosis) – secure airway and ventilate
Toxins:
Narcotic OD – Naloxone 2mg IV/IO/IN/IM
A
Hypoglycemia – 0.5 – 1mg/kg (5-10mL/kg of D10W
Hypovolemia – NS Bolus IV/IO
Cardiac Arrest, General - Peds
CPR Quality
 Push hard (>1/3 of anterior-posterior
diameter of chest) and fast (at least 100/min)
and allow for complete chest recoil
 Minimize interruptions in compressions
o Count out loud or use metronome
 Avoid excessive ventilations
o One breath every 6 seconds
 Rotate compressors every 2 minutes
 If no advanced airway, 15:2
compressions:ventilations ratio.
 If advanced airway, give 10 breaths per
minute with continuous chest compression**
Shock Energy for Defibrillation
 First Shock 2 J/kg
 Second Shock 4 J/kg
 Subsequent Shocks >4 J/kg
Maximum 10 J/kg or adult dose
Advanced Airway
 If no advanced airway is in place, ventilate with 1 breath every 3-5 seconds (12-
20 breaths per minute)*
 When bag-mask ventilation is unsuccessful... the LMA is acceptable when used
by experienced providers to provide a patent airway and support ventilation.
 Waveform capnography to confirm and monitor airway placement
 Once advanced airway in place, give 1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths per
minute)**
Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)
 Glucose, Pulse and Blood Pressure check and documentation
 Spontaneous arterial pressure waves in the intra-arterial monitoring
Reversible Causes
 Hypovolemia
 Hypoxia
 Hydrogen Ion (acidosis)
 Hypoglycemia
 Hypo- / Hyperkalemia
 Hypothermia
 Tension Pneumothorax
 Tamponade, Cardiac
 Toxins
 Thrombosis, Pulmonary
 Thrombosis, Coronary
 Trauma

Pearls
RECOMMENDED EXAM: Mental Status
 IO is the preferred access for all Pediatric Cardiac Arrest patients.
 In order to successfully resuscitate a Pediatric patient, a cause of arrest must be identified and corrected.
 Airway is the most important intervention. This should be addressed immediately. Survival is often dependent on successful airway management.
 Airway management with BVM is often sufficient in the Pediatric patient.
 If evidence of tension pneumothorax - unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation, JVD, tachycardia, hypotension – consider needle thoracostomy.
Chest decompression may be attempted at the 2
nd intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
 For Neonatal Resuscitation, refer to Neonatal Resuscitation, p. 109.

 Consider Ketamine if needed for sedation during resuscitation if patient consciousness during CPR is interfering in care.
