Airway Management, Peds Protocol
(if not already done) p90
Optimize Ventilation and Oxygenation
SpO2 >93%
EtCO2 goal 35-45mmHg
Post Resuscitation Care - Peds

Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age (if known), Estimated Weight or Broselow
 Events Surrounding Arrest
 Estimated Time of Arrest
 Past Medical History (if known)
Differential
 Hypoxemia, Hypovolemia, Hypotension, Acidosis
 Toxins, Tension Pneumo, Pericardial Tamponade
 Hypoglycemia, Trauma
 Respiratory Failure
-Foreign Body, Infectious, Epiglottitis
 Medications
 Concern for Foreign Body
Aspiration
 Body Temperature
 History of Congenital Heart
Defect
Pearls
RECOMMENDED EXAM: Mental Status
 *if <40kg use saline bag procedure
 Monitor and treat for agitation and seizures.
 Monitor and treat hypoglycemia.
 If evidence of tension pneumothorax - unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation, JVD, tachycardia, hypotension – consider needle thoracostomy.
Chest decompression may be attempted at the 2
nd intercostal space, mid clavicular line.
 Hyperventilation is a significant cause of hypotension / recurrent cardiac arrest in post resuscitation phase; avoid at all costs.
