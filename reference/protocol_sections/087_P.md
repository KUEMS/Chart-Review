Pearls
RECOMMENDED EXAM: Mental Status
 Probable Sinus tachycardia – P-waves present before every QRS, constant P-R interval. Infants usually <220/min, Children usually <180/min.
 Probable SVT – history vague, nonspecific with abrupt rate change, P-waves absent / abnormal, HR not variable. Infants usually >220/min, Children >180/min.
 Don’t delay treatment to get 12-lead ECG if patient is unstable.
 Alternative vagal maneuvers include carotid massage, hold breath in young children, bag valve mask ventilation, cold water or ice to face for 10-15 sec, bring knees to chest
and hold, hold infant upside down
