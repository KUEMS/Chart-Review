Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age (if known), Estimated Weight or Broselow
 Events Surrounding Rhythm Change
 Estimated Time of Events
 Past Medical History (if known)
Differential
 Hypoxemia, Hypovolemia, Hypotension, Acidosis
 Toxins, Tension Pneumo, Pericardial Tamponade
 Hypoglycemia, Sepsis
 Increased Intracranial Pressure (trauma, shunt, NAT)
Pearls
RECOMMENDED EXAM: Mental Status
 Cardiopulmonary Compromise defined as hypotension, altered mental status, signs of inadequate perfusion.
 Maintain patent airway throughout evaluation and treatment; assist breathing as necessary.
 Don’t delay treatment to get 12-lead ECG if patient is unstable.
