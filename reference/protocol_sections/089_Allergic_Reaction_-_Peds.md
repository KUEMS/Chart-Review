Allergic Reaction - Peds
100
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, SpO2, EtCO2, RR
 SAMPLE history
 OPQRST history
 Onset and Location of Symptoms
Differential
 Urticaria (Rash Only)
 Anaphylaxis (Systemic Effect)
 Shock (Vascular Effect)
 Angioedema
 Aspiration / Airway
Obstruction
 Vasovagal Event
 Asthma / COPD
 CHF
 Lung Sounds before AND after
intervention
 Allergen Exposure
 Toxic / Environmental Exposure
 Subjective throat “tightness” OR “closing”
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Skin, Cardivascular, Pulmonary
 Epinephrine Infusion: Mix 1mg (1:1,000) in 250mL NS. If worsening or refractory anaphylaxis, contact Med Control first. Start at 2mcg/min, titrate up.
 *if <40kg use saline bag procedure
 Famotidine dilution no longer required. Infuse over 2 minutes.
 In general, the shorter the time from allergen contact to start of symptoms, the more severe the reaction.
 Consider the Airway Management Protocol early in patients with Severe Allergic Reaction or subjective throat closing.
 Imminent Cardiac Arrest should be considered in patients with severe bradycardia, unresponsiveness, no palpable radial or brachial pulse.
 If parents have administered diphenhydramine (Benadryl) prior to EMS arrival, confirm medication given as well as dose.
