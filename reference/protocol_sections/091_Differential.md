REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Skin, Cardivascular, Pulmonary
 A Brief Resolved Unexplained Episode (BRUE) occurs in children <1 year of age and may be referred to as an “Apparent Life Threatening Episode (ALTE)” or “Near-miss SIDS”;
it is an episode that is frightening to the observer/caregiver and involves some combination of the following: Apnea, Color Change, Marked Change In Muscle Tone, and
Choking or Gagging.
 The incidence of BRUE was found to be 7.5% in one studied out-of-hospital infant population
The overwhelming majority of BRUE patients (83%) appeared to be in no apparent distress by EMS assessment
Nearly half of the patients assessed by EMS to be in no apparent distress (48%) were later found to have significant illness upon ED evaluation
 This is why the history of a BRUE must always result in transport to an emergency department regardless of the infant’s appearance at the time of EMS assessment
 If the parent or guardian is refusing EMS transport, OLMC must be contacted prior to executing a refusal. Be supportive of parents as they may feel embarrassed for calling
when the child now appears well.
 Always have a high index of suspicion for Non-Accidental Trauma (NAT). It affects all ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses and family types.
