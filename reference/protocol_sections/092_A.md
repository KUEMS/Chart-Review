Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, SpO2, Blood Glucose, Skin, Respiratory Rate and Effort, Neuro Exam
 Do NOT administer oral glucose to patients that can’t swallow or adequately protect their airway.
 Do NOT give Bicarb to patients with hyperglycemia suspected to be in DKA – This has been proven to result in WORSE outcomes for the patients.
 Prolonged hypoglycemia may not respond to Glucagon; be prepared to start an IV and administer IV Dextrose.
 Infants and patients with congenital liver diseases may not respond to Glucagon due to poor liver glycogen stores.
 Patients on oral diabetes medications are at a very high risk of recurrent hypoglycemia and should be transported. Contact Medical Control for advice/patient counseling if
patient is refusing. See Refusal after Hypoglycemia Treatment Protocol for additional information as necessary.
 Always consider intentional insulin overdose, and ask patients / family / friends / witnesses about suicidal ideation, comments or gestures.
