Pearls
 In the setting of CARDIAC ARREST ONLY, any preexisting dialysis shunt or central line may be used by EMS for fluid and medication administration.
 For patients who are hemodynamically unstable or in extremis, Medical Control MUST be contacted prior to accessing any preexisting catheters.
 Upper extremity sites are preferred over Lower Extremity sites. Lower Extremity Ivs are discouraged in patients with peripheral vascular disease or diabetes.
 In patients with hemodialysis catheters, avoid IV attempts, blood draws, injections or blood pressures in the extremity on the affected side.
 Saline Locks are acceptable in cases where access may be necessary but the patient is not volume depleted; having an IV does not mandate IV Fluid infusion.
 The preferred order of IV Access is: Peripheral IV, Intraosseous IV, IN/IM access UNLESS medical acuity or situation dictate otherwise.
 Remember: Proximal Humerus IO is contraindicated in patients <18 years old.
