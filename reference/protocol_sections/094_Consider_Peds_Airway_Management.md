 Patients are unreliable historians in overdose situations, particularly in suicide attempts. Trust what they tell you, but verify (pill bottles, circumstances, etc.)
 Critical Scene Information: Time of Ingestion, Number and Type of meds ingested, Seizure or mental status changes; Please consider bringing pill bottles, contents, emesis and
reliable contact info to the ED; this will be important in patient evaluation and assessment
 Be careful of off-gassing in cases of inhalation of volatile agents
 Many intentional overdoses involve multiple substances, some with cardiac toxicity; a 12-Lead ECG should be obtained on all overdoses situation permitting
 Contact Poison Control for all non-opiate overdoses: 1-800-222-1222
