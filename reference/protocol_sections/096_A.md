Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Vital Signs, GCS, Neuro Exam, Lung Sounds, Abdominal Exam, Musculoskeletal Exam, Area of Pain
 Provider Discretion to be used for patients suffering from chronic pain related issues. Please note that history of chronic pain does not preclude the patient
from treatment of acute pain related etiologies.
 Pain severity (0-10) is a vital sign to be recorded pre- and post-medication delivery and at disposition.
 As with all medical interventions, assess and document change in patient condition pre- and post-treatment.
 Opiate naive patients can have a much more dramatic response to medications than expected; start low and titrate up as appropriate.
 Allow for position of maximum comfort as situation allows.
 Acetaminophen and/or Ibuprofen if not contraindicated may be considered for analgesic benefit in fever.
 **Ketorolac is contraindicated in: <2 years old, pregnancy, anticoagulation or bleeding diatheses, anticipated surgery, NSAID use (including EMS
administered ibuprofen), GI bleeding, possible intracranial hemorrhage, known renal disease. Extreme caution in females of reproductive age and
potential renal insufficiency.
 *Oral medications are contraindicated in anyone who may need an emergent surgery or procedure; “if in doubt, don’t give PO”.
