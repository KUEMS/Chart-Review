Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Blood Sugar, SpO2, GCS, Neuro Exam
 Consider antipyretic treatment in setting of suspected Febrile seizure and patient has returned to baseline mental status.
 Midazolam is effective in terminating seizures. Do not delay IM/IN administration to obtain IV access in an actively seizing patient.
 Do not hesitate to treat recurrent, prolonged (>1 minute) seizure activity. Have a low threshold to give IN Midazolam rather than spend time on IV Access.
 Status epilepticus is a seizure lasting greater than 5 minutes OR >2 successive seizures without recovery of consciousness in between. These patients require airway
management and rapid transport to the most appropriate Pediatric ICU Capable facility.
 Assess for possibility of occult trauma, substance abuse.
 Active seizure in known or suspected pregnancy >20 weeks, give Magnesium 4gm IV/IO over 2-3 minutes.
 Some children may be on a Ketogenic Diet Goal of Blood Sugar <50 to manage seizures, consider contacting Medical Control.
