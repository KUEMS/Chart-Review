Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, BP, RR, SpO2
 SAMPLE history
 OPQRST history
 Source of blood loss, if any (GI, vaginal, AAA, ectopic)
 Source of fluid loss, if any (vomiting, diarrhea, fever)
 Pregnancy history
Differential
 Cardiac Dysrhythmia
 Hypoglycemia
 Ectopic Pregnancy
 AAA
 Sepsis
 Occult Trauma
 Adrenal Insufficiency
 Mental Status
 Pale, Cool Skin
 Delayed Cap Refill
 Coffee Ground Emesis
 Tarry Stools
 Allergen Exposure
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, RR, Lung sounds, JVD
 Shock may present with initially normal VS and progress insidiously; follow frequent blood pressures, particularly if the patient “looks sicker than Vital Signs”
 *if <40kg use saline bag procedure
 Tachycardia may be the first and only sign of shock in the pediatric population; remember – Peds patients compensate to a point, then crash quickly
 If evidence or suspicion of trauma (accidental OR non-accidental), move to Hypotension/Shock (Trauma) Protocol early
 Hypotension is a LATE finding in pediatric patients, and is an ominous sign that they are losing their ability to compensate
Medical Protocols - Pediatric
Acute Adrenal Insufficiency
State where the body cannot produce enough
steroids. Primary adrenal disease vs. recent
discontinuation of steroids (Prednisone) after
long term use.
