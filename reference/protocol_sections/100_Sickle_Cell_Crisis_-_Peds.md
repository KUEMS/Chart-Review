Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Vital Signs, GCS, Neuro Exam, Lung Sounds, Abdominal Exam, Musculoskeletal Exam, Area of Pain
 Provider Discretion to be used for patients suffering from chronic pain related issues. Please note that history of chronic pain does not preclude the patient
from treatment of acute pain related etiologies.
 Pain severity (0-10) is a vital sign to be recorded pre- and post-medication delivery and at disposition.
 Sickle Cell Anemia is a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in African Americans; pain crises result from the occlusion of blood vessels by
masses of misshapen blood cells during times of crisis.
 Sickle Pain Crises occur typically in the joints and back. Liver, Pulmonary and CNS involvement can present with RUQ pain, hypoxia or stroke.
 Patients with sickle cell disease have a high incidence of life-threatening conditions at a very young age.
 Remember: sickle cell patients live with pain every day, and frequently use distraction techniques to cope. Just because a sickle cell patient does not show
classic signs of acute pain or are using a distraction device (like phones) does not mean they are not in pain.
