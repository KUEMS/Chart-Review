Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Head, Neck, Blood Glucose
• Pay special attention to head and neck exam for bruising or signs of injury.
• Syncope/Altered Mental Status may be the presenting sign of environmental hazards / toxins. Protect yourself and other providers / community if concern. Involve
Hazmat early.
• Safer to assume hypoglycemia if doubt exists. Recheck blood sugar after dextrose/oral glucose administration and reassess.
• Do not let EtOH fool you! Alcoholics frequently develop hypoglycemia, Alcoholic Ketoacidosis (AKA) and often hide traumatic injuries!
BE-FAST procedure p165
A Peds IV Access Protocol p104
A
Consider IVF bolus IV/IO, repeat as
indicated for patient condition
Consider causes of presyncope/impending arrest syndrome:
 Acute coranary syndrome (ACS) : look for evidence of ischemia
 Tachydysrhythmias
 Bradydysrythmias and heart bloks
 Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW): look for short PR, prolonged QRS and a delta wave
 Brugada Syndrome: look for rugada sin with coved ST segment elevation >2mm in >1 V1-V3 followed by a negative T Wave
 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopaathy (HCM): look for evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy with deep narrow “dagger like” Q waves in lateral and inferior leads, may also have
left atrial enlargement
 Long or short QT-intervals: look for a QTc <300 or >450
 Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD): look for epsilon waves +/- T wave inversions in V1-V3
 Miscellanous: PE, right sided heart strain, electrolyte abnormalities, ICH, etc.
