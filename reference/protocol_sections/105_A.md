Traumatic Cardiac Arrest – Peds, Trauma
Differential
 Hypovolemic Shock
-External Hemorrhage
-Internal Hemorrhage
-Unstable Pelvic Fracture
 Tension Pneumothorax
 Medical Condition Causing
Trauma (i.e. Cardiac Arrest)
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Pupillary Light Reflex, Palpation of Pulses, Heart and Lung Auscultation
 This protocol is compliant with the Joint Position Statement of the ACS, ACEP, NAEMSP and AAP and can be referenced here:

 Injuries incompatible with life include; decapitation, incineration, massively deforming head or chest injury, dependent lividity, rigor mortis
 As with all trauma patients, DO NOT delay transport
 Consider using medical cardiac arrest protocols if uncertainty exists regarding etiology of arrest
 Use of a long spine board will make chest compressions more effective; however, if spinal immobilization interferes with CPR use reasonable effort to limit
patient and spine movement
 Be aware that these may be crime scenes: do your best to avoid disturbing forensic evidence
 If provider safety becomes a concern, transport of deceased patients to the hospital is acceptable
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, if known
 Mechanism of Injury
 Events leading up to arrest
