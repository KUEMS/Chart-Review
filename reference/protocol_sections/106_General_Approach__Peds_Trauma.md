Bites and Envenomations – Peds, Trauma
Differential
 Penetrating Trauma
 Dry Bite (Snake)
 Abscess/Cellulitis
 Non-Accidental Trauma
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, Pulses distal to wound
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Description or photo of offending creature
 Tetanus status
 Immunization History of
Creature (if known)
 Domestic vs. Wild Animal
 Allergic Reaction
 Hypotension, Shock, Fever
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Evidence of Intoxication, Affected Extremity Neurovascular Exam
 Cat bites may not initially appear serious, but can progress rapidly to severe infection
 Human bites have higher rates of infection than animal bites and need to be evaluated in the Emergency Department for antibiotics
 Bites on the hands and lacerations over knuckles should be assumed to be “Fight Bites” until proven otherwise, and need evaluation
 It is not necessary to bring the offending insects, animals or reptiles to the ED for identification; this may result in added danger to others
 Brown recluse spider bites are usually painless at the time of bite. Pain and tissue necrosis develops over hours to days
 Immunocompromised patients have higher risk of infection – Think: Diabetes, Chemotherapy, Organ Transplant
