Burns – Peds, Trauma
Differential
 Blast Injury
 Radiation Injury
 Electrical Injury
 Cyanokit Need?
 Cellulitis
 Dermatitis
 Drug Reaction (Stevens-Johnson
Syndrome)
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Mechanism of Burn (heat, gas, chemical)
 Time of Injury
 Singed Facial Hair
 Wheezing, Hoarseness
 Subjective Throat Swelling
 Loss of Consciousness
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Lung Sounds, HEENT, Posterior Pharynx
 Safety First! Assure a Chemical source of burn is NOT a hazard to responders. Assure an Electrical source of burn is OFF or no longer contacting pt. Never overlook the
possibility that a burn injury may be the result of child abuse / non-accidental trauma.
 High Voltage Electrical Burns (>600 volts) require spinal immobilization, continuous cardiac monitor and IV access regardless of external appearance of injury
 Chemical burns require removal of contaminated clothing, brush away dry powder before irrigation. Flush with copious warm water on scene and continue irrigation en
route. Be sure to brush excess away and remove contaminated clothing BEFORE beginning irrigation Burns to face and eyes, remove contact lenses prior to irrigation
 Early intubation is strongly recommended if suspicion of inhalation injury. Suspicion is high in patients involved in an enclosed space fire, who have facial burns or show signs
of airway involvement; carbonaceous sputum, facial burns or edema, hoarseness, singed nasal hairs, agitation, hypoxia or cyanosis
 Indications of possible Cyanide Poisoning - Exposure to fumes from burning Nitrile (polyurethane, vinyl) Seizures, coma, cardiac arrest, headache, vertigo and/or cherry red
skin color from increased venous O2 concentration
