Management of Crush Injury Patient
Crush Injury should be suspected in prolonged
pinnings >1 hour, AND proximal to the knee or
elbow.
This protocol is NOT intended for hands or feet
trapped in machinery or farm equipment
Hemodynamically
Unstable
No

Prolonged Crush Injury – Peds, Trauma
Differential
 Compartment Syndrome
 Entrapment without Crush
 Fracture, Sprain, Strain
 Pelvic Fracture
 Hypothermia
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, GCS
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Crushed under heavy load ≥30 min
 Building collapse, trench collapse,
industrial accident, heavy equipment
pinning
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Vital Signs, GCS, Lung Sounds, Neuro Exam, Musculoskeletal Exam
 Structural Collapse, Crush Scenes are often full of hazards, provider safety is the most important consideration
 Patients may become hypothermic, even in warm environments
-Hypothermia can lead to coagulopathy, which will increase bleeding times and have worse outcomes for the patient
 Crush injuries can result in hyperkalemia from shift of Potassium out of injured cells. Cardiac monitoring is required and 12-lead ECG preferred whenever
possible (as dicated by the situation)
 Monitor extremities for signs of compartment syndrome after crush injury; Pain, Pallor, Paresthesias, Paralysis, Pulselessness and Poikilothermia (inability
to regulate core body temperature)
 * Sodium Bicarb Infusion: 1mEq/kg added to 1L NS, administered 20mL/kg IV just prior to extrication
 **Utilize different IV lines or flush between bicarb and calcium to prevent precipitation in the line
