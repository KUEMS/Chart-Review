Near-Drowning / Submersion Injury – Peds, Trauma
Differential
 Spinal Trauma
 Pre-Existing Medical Condition
 Hypothermia
 Aspiration
 The Bends
 Pressure Injury
Barotrauma
Decompression Sickness
 Post-Immersion Syndrome
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Submersion in water regardless of depth
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Temperature of water
 Mental Status Changes
 Degree of Water
Contamination
 Vomiting
 Coughing, Wheezing, Rales,
Rhonchi, Stridor
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 Have a HIGH index of suspicion for possible spinal injuries. Any diving injury or submersion with unclear details should be fully immobilized
 Hypothermia is often associated with near-drowning and submersion injuries. Consider the Hypothermia Protocol as appropriate
 All patients with Near-Drowning / Submersion Injury should be transported for evaluation due to delayed presentation of respiratory failure
 With diving injuries (decompression / barotrauma) consider availability of a hyperbaric chamber; contact Medical Control early.
 Near-drowning patients who are awake and cooperative but with respiratory distress may benefit from CPAP / Positive Pressure Ventilation
