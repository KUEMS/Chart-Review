Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, Mental Status
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Time and length of exposure to hot environment
 Hot, dry or sweaty skin
 Seizures
 Nausea
 Hypotension, Shock,
Fever
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Skin, HEENT, Neuro, Evidence of Intoxication, Mental Status
 Extremes of Age are more prone to heat emergencies due to inability to easily self-extricate from hot environments
 Patients on Tricyclic Antidepressants, Anticholinergics, Diuretics (i.e. Lasix) are more susceptible to heat emergencies due to medication effects
 Cocaine, amphetamines and salicylates all may elevate body temperature or interfere with the ability to auto-regulate
 Sweating generally disappears as body temperature rises above 104oF
 If Heat Cramps resolved without IV Access or Medications, patients may refuse transport, IF tolerating oral fluids and VS normal
