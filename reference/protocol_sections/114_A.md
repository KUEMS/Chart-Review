Differential
 Globe Rupture
 Acute Closed Angle Glaucoma
 Stroke
 Retinal Artery Occlusion
 Chemical Burn
 Retinal Venous Thrombus
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Age, VS, Visual Acuity
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Time of Injury
 Involved Chemical MSDS
 Contact / Corrective Lens Use

 Rust Ring
 “Lowering Shade” in Vision
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: VS, GCS, Visual Acuity, Neuro Exam, Extraocular Movements
 Stabilize any penetrating objects. DO NOT remove any embedded / impaled objects
 If Long Spine Board not indicated, transport with head of stretcher elevated to 60 degrees to help reduce intraocular pressure
 Remove contact lenses when possible
 Always cover both eyes to prevent further injury
 Orbital fractures increase concern for globe or optic nerve injury; follow visual acuity and extraocular movements for changes
 Normal visual acuity can be present, even with severe injury
