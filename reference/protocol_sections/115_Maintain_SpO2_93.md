Head Injury – Peds, Trauma
Differential
 Skull fracture
 Epidural hematoma
 Concussion, Contusion,
Laceration, Hematoma
 Non-Accidental Trauma
 Spinal Cord Injury
 Subdural Hematoma
 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Type of injury
 Mechanism (blunt vs. penetrating)
 Loss Of Consciousness
 Vomiting, Altered Mental Status
 SAMPLE History
 OPQRST History
 Evidence of Intoxication
 Evidence of Multi-System
Trauma
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 If GCS <13 consider Air transport or Rapid Transport to Leveled Trauma Facility
 Airway interventions can be detrimental to patients with head injury by raising intracranial pressure, worsening hypoxia (causing secondary brain
injury) and increasing risk of aspiration. Whenever possible these patients should be managed in the least invasive manner to safely maintain O2
saturation >90% (ie. NRB, BVM with 100% O2, etc.)
 Acute herniation should be suspected when the following signs are present: acute unilateral dilated and non-reactive pupil, abrupt deterioration in mental
status, abrupt onset of motor posturing, abrupt increase in blood pressure, abrupt decrease in heart rate.
 Only in suspected acute herniation – increase ventilatory rate with target EtCO2 30-35mmHg
 Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may cause hypertension and bradycardia (Cushings response)
 Hypotension usually indicates injury or shock unrelated to the head injury and should be treated aggressively
 Most important vital sign to monitor and document is level of consciousness (GCS)
 Concussions are periods of confusion or loss of consciousness (LOC) associated with trauma which may have resolved by the time EMS arrives. Any
confusion or mental status abnormality should be transported to an Emergency Department. Any questions or clarifications, contact Medical Control.
