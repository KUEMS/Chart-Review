Hemorrhage Control – Peds, Trauma
Differential
 Vascular Disruption
 Amputation
 Fracture, Dislocation
 Sprain, Strain
 Abrasion
 Contusion
 Laceration
 Compartment Syndrome
Pertinent Positives and Negatives
 Type of injury
 Mechanism (blunt vs. penetrating)
 Central and Peripheral Pulses
 Neuro Function Distal to Injury
 Time of Injury
 Deformity
 Diminished pulse / capillary
refill
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Mental Status, HEENT, Heart, Lungs, Abdomen, Extremity, Back, Neuro
 Hypotension in trauma needs blood products early, so minimize scene time. Goal for scene time in major trauma cases should be <10 min
 Multiple casualty incident or obvious life threatening hemorrhage, consider Tourniquet Procedure and/or Hemostatic Dressing FIRST
 Hemostatic Dressings are appropriate for hemorrhage that can’t be controlled with a tourniquet, such as junctional wounds in the groin or axilla.
 Remember - hemostatic agents are contraindicated in wounds that violate the thoracic or abdominal cavity; if unsure, use sterile roll gauze.
 Signs/Symptoms of Shock include: altered mental status, pallor, cap refill >3 sec, faint/absent peripheral pulses, hypotension (age defined)
