Peds, Trauma
Pearls
REQUIRED EXAM: Motor Function both upper and lower extremities, Sensation of upper and lower extremities, subjective abnormal sensation, Tenderness to palpation of bony
prominences OR paraspinal muscles
 *Clinical Intoxication – A transient condition resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other
psychophysiological functions and responses. Common examples include; ataxia, emotional instability, flight of ideas, tangential thought or motor
incoordination.
 **Distracting Injury – Examples include, but are not limited to: long bone fracture, dislocations, large lacerations, deforming injuries, burns OR any
condition preventing patient cooperation with history.
 Torticollis, also known as wryneck, is a twisting of the neck that causes the head to rotate and tilt at an odd angle.
 It is always safer and better patient care to assume that a Spinal Cord injury has occurred and provide protection, and should be the standard of care in
trauma patient management
 Rigid cervical collars and long spine boards have risks and benefits for patients. Spinal immobilization should always be applied when any doubt exists
about the possibility of spinal trauma.
 EXTREMELY thoughtful consideration and careful physical exam should be part of any decision to apply or not apply the spinal immobilization, and must be
well documented.
