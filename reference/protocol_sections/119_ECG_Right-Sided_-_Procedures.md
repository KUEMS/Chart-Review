ECG, Right-Sided - Procedures
To detect right ventricular STEMI associated with occlusion of the Right Coronary Artery, obtain a Right Sided ECG.
Indications of a Right Ventricle Wall infarct may include:
q ST elevation in the inferior leads, II, III and aVF
 ST elevation that is greatest in lead III is especially significant
q ST elevation in V1 (the only precordial lead that faces the RV on standard 12-lead ECG)
q Right Bundle Branch Block, 2
nd and 3rd Degree AV Blocks, ST elevation in V2 50% greater than the ST depression in aVF
Procedure:
q 1. Prepare ECG monitor and connect patient cable to electrodes
q 2. Expose chest and prep as necessary. Modesty of the patient should be respected.
q 3. Apply chest leads and extremity leads using the following landmarks: (Distal to shoulder and distal to hip joint for most accurate ECG)
 V1R: 4
th intercostal space, left sternal border
 V2R: 4
th intercostal space, right sternal border
 V3R: halfway between V2R and V4R, on a diagonal line
 V4R: 5
th intercostal space, right midclavicular line, same horizontal line as V5R and V6R
 V5R: right anterior axillary line, same horizontal line as V4R and V6R
 V6R: right mid-axillary line, same horizontal line as V4R and V5R
q 4. Instruct patient to remain still, minimize artifact as able (examples include stopping motion of ambulance and instructing patient to
remain still)
q 5. Press the brand specific button to acquire the 12-Lead ECG (complete age and gender questions correctly)
q 6. Provide Right Sided ECG to hospital staff, transmit when appropriate
q 7. Document the procedure, time, and results in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR)
