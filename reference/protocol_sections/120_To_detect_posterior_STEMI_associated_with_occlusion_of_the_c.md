# Section 120: To detect posterior STEMI associated with occlusion of the circumflex artery or

---

To detect posterior STEMI associated with occlusion of the circumflex artery or dominant right coronary artery , obain a posterior ECG.
Indications of a posterior wall infarction may include:
q Changes in V1-V3 on the standard 12-lead ECG predominantly, which include
 Horizontal ST depression
 A tall, upright T-wave
 A tall, wide R-wave
 R/S wave ratio greater than one
q Inferior or lateral wall MI (especially if accompanied by ST depression or prominent R waves in leads V1-V3)
Procedure:
q 1. Prepare ECG monitor and connect patient cable to electrodes
q 2. Expose chest and prep as necessary. Modesty of the patient should be respected.
q 3. Place three additional ECG electrodes. TIP: start at V9 (the last electrode) and work forward
 V9: Left spinal border, same horizontal line as V4-6
 V8: midscapular line, same horizontal line as V7 and V9
 V7: posterior axillary line, same horizontal line as V4-6
q 4. Place ECG lead cables as follows (using standard 12-Lead)
 Lead cable V6 connects to electrode V9
 Lead cable V5 connects to electrode V8
 Lead cable V4 connects to electrode V7
 Lead cables V1-V3 are connected the same way as when obtaining a standard 12-lead ECG
q 5. Instruct patient to remain still, minimize artifact as able (examples include stopping motion of ambulance and instructing patient to
remain still)
q 6. Press the brand specific button to acquire the 12-Lead ECG (complete age and gender questions correctly)
q 7. Provide Posterior Sided ECG to hospital staff, transmit when appropriate
q 8. Document the procedure, time, and results in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR)
