# Section 122: Procedure:

---

Procedure:
q 1. Apply probe to patient finger or toe, as recommended by the device manufacturer.
q 2. Allow machine to register oxygen saturation level
q 3. Record time and initial saturation percent on room air if possible on/with the PCR
q 4. Verify pulse rate on machine or with actual manual pulse check of the patient
q 5. Monitor critical patients continuously until arrival at the hospital. If recording a one-time reading, monitor patients for a few
minutes as oxygen saturation can vary
q 6. Document percent of oxygen saturation every time vital signs are recorded and in response to therapy to correct hypoxemia
q 7. In general, normal saturation is 97-99%. Below 93% suspect a respiratory compromise
q 8. Use the pulse oximetry as an added tool for patient evaluation. Treat the patient, not the data provided by the device
q 9. The pulse oximeter reading should never be used to withhold oxygen from a patient in respiratory distress or when it is the standard of
care to apply oxygen despite good pulse oximetry readings, such as chest pain
q 10. Factors which may reduce the reliability of the pulse oximetry reading include :
 Poor peripheral circulation (blood volume, hypotension, hypothermia)
 Excessive pulse oximeter sensor motion
 Fingernail polish (may be removed with acetone pad)
 Carbon monoxide bound to hemoglobin
 Irregular heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation, SVT, etc.)
 Jaundice
 Placement of Blood Pressure cuff on same extremity as pulse ox probe
