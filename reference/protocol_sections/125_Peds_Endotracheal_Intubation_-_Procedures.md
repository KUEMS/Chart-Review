Peds Endotracheal Intubation - Procedures
136
When Considering Intubating ANY Patient, Prepare Materials EARLY:
q Video Laryngoscope on and functioning; Direct Laryngoscope handle with appropriate size blade and bulb function verified
q Proper Size Endotracheal Tube (ETT) PLUS Backup ETT 0.5-1.0mm smaller and BIAD
q Water-soluble lubrication gel, (lubricate distal end of tube at cuff)
q 10mL syringe (larger syringe if low pressure cuff)
q Appropriate size bougie, (insert into ET tube and do no let bougie extend beyond tip of ET tube)
 10fr bougie for use with ETT sizes 4.0 – 6.0
 15fr bougie for use with ETT sizes 6.0 – 8.0
q Tape or ETT securing device
q Proper size oropharyngeal airway
q BVM
q Oxygen Source
q Suction Device
q Stethoscope
q Continuous Digital Waveform Capnography
q Oxygen saturation monitor
q Medications to maintain and support hemodynamic stability (fluids, infusions, push-dose epinephrine, etc.)
Procedure:
q 1. Maintain cervical alignment and immobilization, as necessary
q 3. Check endotracheal tube cuff, lubricate distal end of the tube
q 4. Confirm patient attached to cardiac monitor and oxygen saturation monitor
q 5. Ready EtCO2 detection device
q 6. Specify personnel to:
 Apply cricoid pressure
 Maintain cervical alignment and immobilization during procedure
 Watch cardiac and oxygen saturation monitors
q 7. Preoxygenate patient with 100% Oxygen (BVM or NRB) before intubation attempt to achieve O2 saturation >93% for 5 minutes or 8
vital capacity breaths. Have assistant apply cricoid pressure (Sellick’s Maneuver) during entire procedure.
q 8. Remove all foreign objects, such as dentures, Oropharyngeal Airways (OPA), etc., and suction the patients airway if needed.
 May leave an esophageal ETT if prior unsuccessful attempt to use as landmark for second attempt
q 9. Insert the video laryngoscope midline into the patient’s mouth
q 10. Visualize the vocal cords while avoiding any pressure on the teeth
 Ensure that the video laryngoscope is recording the intubation procedure
 Bougie use is mandatory for video laryngoscopy
q 11. Insert the endotracheal tube until the cuff is visualized passing the vocal cords.
 Insert far enough so that balloon port tubing is even with the lips
 Typical depth = tube size (ID) x3 (example would be tube depth of 24 for a 8.0mm tube)
q 12. Remove the laryngoscope blade
q 13. Inflate the endotracheal cuff with the syringe with 5-10cc of air (low pressure cuff may require larger volume) and remove the syringe
from inflation valve
q 14. Ventilate with BVM and confirm tube placement:
 Observe immediate (within 6 breaths) EtCO2 waveform and number with capnography
 Watch for chest rise AND
 Auscultate abdomen, listening for air movement in the stomach to ensure tube is not esophageal
 Auscultate bilateral breath sounds to confirm tube placement
 Note: Regardless of apparent presence of lung sounds, tube misting, chest rise, AND/OR lack of gastric sounds:
 if EtCO2 does NOT indicate proper tube location (alveolar waveform), ETT must be removed.
q 15. Observe oxygen saturation
q 16. Verify ETT cuff pressure using manometer
