King LT-D and King LTS-D Laryngeal Tube Airway -
Procedures
138
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q Correctly sized Laryngeal Tube Airway (LTA) – see chart below
q Bag Valve Mask
q Oxygen Reservoir
q Suction Device
q Bite Block AND/OR endotracheal tube holder (if available)
q Appropriately sized syringes for inflating cuff
q End Tidal CO2 and Oxygen Saturation Monitoring Devices
Procedure:
q 1. Pre-oxygenate patient with 100% Oxygen via Bag Valve Mask or spontaneous ventilation to achieve O2 saturation of >93% if possible
q 2. Check the integrity of the cuff inflation system and pilot balloon
q 3. Fully deflate the cuff with the syringe
q 4. Lubricate the posterior distal tip of the device with a water soluble lubricant
q 5. Place patient in neutral sniffing position (if no Cervical Spine/Spinal Injury suspected)
 For patient with suspected Cervical Spine injury, perform two-person insertion technique
 One person maintains manual in-line cervical spine stabilization while the other person proceeds with procedure
q 6. Pull mandible down to open mouth
q 7. Insert uninflated device into oral cavity with midline or a lateral technique
q 8. Advance the tip behind the base of the tongue while rotating tube back to midline so that the blue orientation line faces the chin of the
patient.
q 9. Without exerting excessive force, advance tube until base of the colored connector is aligned with teeth or gums
q 10. Inflate the King with the appropriate volume:
 If inflated King Airway insertion is difficult, perform jaw thrust, pulling the tongue forward. Alternately, a laryngoscope may be used to
lift the jaw/mandible to facilitate insertion.
q 11. Attach the BVM to the King.
q 12. While bagging the patient, gently withdraw the tube until ventilation becomes easy and free flowing (large tidal volume with
minimal airway pressure).
q 13. Adjust cuff inflation if necessary to obtain a seal of the airway at the peak ventilatory pressure employed.
q 14. Obtain End-tidal CO2, auscultate breath sounds bilaterally, look for chest excursion, and check oxygen saturation
 If digital capnography is not available, arrange for intercept with capable service MUST be completed.
q 15. Secure in the midline to help maintain a good seal over the larynx .
q 16. Place bite block, oral airway or endotracheal tube holder (if available) between teeth to prevent biting tube
q 17. Place orogastric tube and attach to low continuous suction as directed in the applicable procedure to assist in gastric
decompression
q 18. Ensure C-spine is still immobilized
q 19. If repeated attempts are made, oxygenate with 100% O2 for 2 minutes between attempts
q 20. **Follow manufacturers suggested guidelines at all times**
q 21. Document EtCO2 waveform and reading continuously at time of EACH patient movement, including waveform and reading at time of
transfer of care at the Emergency Department.

4 Red 5-6 feet 18/10 60-80 Up to 18
5 Purple >6 feet 18/10 70-90 Up to 18
Note: regardless of the apparent presence of lung sounds, tube misting and chest rise, or lack of gastric sounds, if ETCO2 does NOT indicate
proper tube location (alveolar waveform), Advanced Airway must be removed.
