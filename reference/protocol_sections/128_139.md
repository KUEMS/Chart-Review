Procedures
2. Advance the tip of the tube behind the base of the
tongue (see figure 1). Then rotate the tube back to the
midline so that the blue orientation line faces the chin of
the patient (see figure 2).
4. Attach BVM to King LT. While bagging the Patient,
gently withdraw the tube until ventilation becomes easy
and free flowing (large tidal volume with minimal airway
pressure). Adjust cuff inflation to maintain seal at the
peak ventilatory pressure employed.
King LT Airway – The correctly placed King LT airway lies with the tip resting in
the upper esophagus. The distal cuff inflates in the esophagus, isolating the
larygopharynx from the esophagus. The proximal cuff inflates at the base of the
tongue. It isolates larygopharynx from the oropharynx and the nasopharynx.
1. Place Patient in neutral (sniffing position if no cervical
spine injury suspected) and pull down on the mandible to
open the mouth. Insert the King LT into the oral cavity
from either a midline or lateral approach.
3. Without exerting force, advance tube until base of connector is
aligned with the teeth or gums. Then inflate cuff with appropriate
volume.
