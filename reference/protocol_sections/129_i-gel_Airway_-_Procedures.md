i-gel Airway - Procedures
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q Correctly sized i-gel Airway Device – see chart below
q Bag Valve Mask
q Oxygen Reservoir
q Suction Device
q Appropriate endotracheal tube holder (if available)
q End Tidal CO2 and Oxygen Saturation Monitoring Devices
Procedure:
q 1. Pre-oxygenate patient with 100% Oxygen via Bag Valve Mask or spontaneous ventilation to achieve O2 saturation of >93% if possible
q 2. Lubricate the posterior distal tip of the device with a thin layer of water soluble lubricant
q 3. Place patient in neutral sniffing position (if no Cervical Spine/Spinal Injury suspected)
 For patient with suspected Cervical Spine injury, perform two-person insertion technique
 One person maintains manual in-line cervical spine stabilization while the other person proceeds with procedure
q 4. Pull mandible down to open mouth
q 5. Insert device into oral cavity with midline or a lateral technique
q 6. Advance the tip behind the base of the tongue with the i-gel cuff outlet facing toward the chin of the patient
 NOTE: If necessary, the upper airway should be suctioned prior to attempted insertion
q 7. Without exerting excessive force, advance tube downwards and backwards along the hard palate with a continuous but gentle push
until definitive resistance is felt.
 WARNING: Do not apply excessive force on the device during insertion.
8. The incisors should be resting on the device integrated bite block.
q 9. Attach the BVM to the i-gel.
q 10. Obtain End-Tidal CO2, auscultate breath sounds bilaterally, look for chest excursion, and check oxygen saturation
 If digital capnography is not available, arrange for intercept with capable service MUST be completed.
q 11. Secure in the midline to help maintain a good seal over the larynx .
q 12. Place orogastric tube in side port and advance to appropriate position. Attach to low continuous suction as directed in the applicable
procedure to assist in gastric decompression
q 13. Ensure C-spine is still immobilized
q 14. If repeated attempts are made, oxygenate with 100% O2 for 2 minutes between attempts
q 15. **Follow manufacturers suggested guidelines at all times**
q 16. Document EtCO2 waveform and reading continuously at time of EACH patient movement, including waveform and reading at time of
transfer of care at the Emergency Department.
Note: regardless of the apparent presence of lung sounds, tube misting and chest rise, or lack of gastric sounds, if ETCO2 does NOT indicate
proper tube location (alveolar waveform), Advanced Airway must be removed.
