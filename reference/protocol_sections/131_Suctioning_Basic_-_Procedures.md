Suctioning (Basic) - Procedures
Procedure:
q 1. Ensure suction device is in proper working order with suction tip in place.
q 2. Set mechanical suction device to appropriate setting (Adult: 120-150mmHg OR Pediatric: 80-100mmHg).
q 3. Preoxygenate the patient.
q 4. Explain the procedure to the patient, if they are coherent.
q 5. Examine the oropharynx and remove any potential foreign bodies or material that may occlude the airway if dislodged by the su ction
device.
q 6. If applicable, remove ventilation devices (i.e. BVM, OPA) from the mouth and upper airway.
q 7. Insert into mouth without finger hole covered
q 8. Once inserted, cover the finger hole with a gloved finger to remove any secretions, blood, or other substances. The alert patient may
assist with this procedure. Continue to cover the finger hole while removing.
q 9. Max suction time:
 Adult - 15 seconds
 Pediatric - 10 seconds
 Infant - 5 seconds
q 10. Reattach ventilation device (i.e. BVM) and resume ventilations or patient assistance, as applicable.
q 11. Record the time and result of the suctioning procedure in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
Procedure:
Permanent Tracheostomy (upper airway structures surgically removed and trachea surgically attached to skin stoma)
q Suction of visible structures in opening in neck (upper airway is surgically absent and aspiration not possible)
q Ventilate as necessary through stoma
q Consider ALS Intercept for intubation if any concerns about airway, ventilation or patient stability
Temporary Tracheostomy (a metal or plastic tube is placed through the anterior neck and is held in place with ties around the neck)
q Suction visible entrance to inner trach tube only
q Ventilate as necessary by attaching bag-valve directly to tube (an adapter from an ET tube may be needed to make the connection
q If ventilating through stoma with uncuffed tube, block the upper airway
q Consider ALS Intercept for intubation if any concerns about airway, ventilation or patient stability
Notes:
Suctioning removes air as well as secretions. Be sure to over-ventilate for 20-30 seconds after suctioning
“Fresh” Tracheostomies (<3 months) are very fragile and have a high potential for creating a false tract if manipulated without trach tube in place – this should
be avoided unless all other airway options have been exhausted and the patient is in extremis
