Suctioning Endotracheal Tube - Procedures
Procedure:
q 1. Ensure suction device is in proper working order with suction tip in place.
q 2. Preoxygenate the patient.
q 3. Attach suction catheter to suction device, keeping sterile plastic covering over catheter.
q 4. For all devices, use the suprasternal notch as the end of the airway. Measure the depth desired for the catheter (judgement must be
used regarding the depth of suctioning with Endotracheal, Cricothyrotomy and Tracheostomy tubes).
q 5. If applicable, remove ventilation devices (i.e. BVM, OPA) from the airway.
q 6. With the thumb port of the catheter uncovered, insert the catheter through the airway device.
q 7. Once the desired depth (measured in #4 above) has been reached, use a gloved finger to occlude the thumb port and remove the
suction catheter slowly.
q 8. A small volume (<10mL) of normal saline may be used to lavage secretions as needed, with supplemental oxygen and/or ventilations x
5 tidal volumes between lavages.
q 9. Reattach ventilation device (i.e. BVM) and ventilate or assist the patient as needed.
q 10. Record the time and result of the suctioning procedure in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
