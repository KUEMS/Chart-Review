Tracheostomy Care - Procedures
Purpose:
q To maintain a patent airway and adequate oxygenation of the patient with a temporary or permanent tracheostomy.
Clinical Indications:
q Patient with temporary or permanent tracheostomies obstructed by secretions.
q Patient unable to replace own tracheostomy tube.
Procedure:
Permanent Tracheostomy (upper airway structures surgically removed and trachea surgically attached to skin stoma)
q Suction through opening in neck (upper airway is surgically absent and aspiration not possible)
q If secretions are very thick, instill 2.5-5mL NS to liquefy secretions
q Ventilate as necessary through stoma
q Consider intubation
q Insert ET tube through stoma until cuff is past opening
q Inflate cuff with 6-8mL of air
q Auscultate bilaterally over axilla and stomach to confirm placement
q Connect end-tidal CO2 monitoring as standard
q Secure ET tube
q ET tube may only be shortened to where the balloon inflation line separates from the tube
Temporary Tracheostomy (a metal or plastic tube is placed through the anterior neck and is held in place with ties around the neck)
q Suction through inner trach tube
q If secretions are very thick, instill 2.5-5mL NS to liquefy secretions
q If outer tube has been displaced or is blocked, remove and replace it with patient’s spare tube or an ET tube
q Ventilate as necessary by attaching bag-valve directly to tube (an adapter from an ET tube may be needed to make the connection
q If ventilating through stoma with uncuffed tube, block the upper airway
q Consider intubation
IF ABLE To Intubate Through Stoma
q Remove tracheostomy tube
q Insert ET tube through stoma until cuff is past skin opening
q Inflate cuff with 6-8mL of air
q IF uncuffed ET tube was used, upper airway must be blocked when ventilating
q Auscultate bilaterally over the axilla and stomach to confirm placement
q Connect End-tidal CO2 monitoring as standard
q Secure ET tube
q ET tube may only be shortened to where the balloon inflation line separates from the tube
IF NOT ABLE To Intubate Through Stoma
q Intubate through upper airway
q Pass cuff of tube BELOW stoma opening in anterior neck (partner or assistant to visually verify externally)
q Inflate cuff with 6-8mL of air
q Ventilate, blocking opening in anterior neck
q Auscultate bilateally over axilla and stomach to confirm placement
q Connect End-tidal CO2 monitoring as standard
q Secure ET tube
q No shortening of ET tube permitted
Notes:
q Suctioning removes air as well as secretions. Be sure to over-ventilate for 20-30 seconds after suctioning
q “Fresh” Tracheostomies (<3 months) are very fragile and have a high potential for creating a false tract if manipulated without trach tube in place – this
should be avoided unless all other airway options have been exhausted and the patient is in extremis
