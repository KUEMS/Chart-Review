Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) -
Procedures
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q Medical Director approved Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Device as per manufacturer written procedure.
Procedure:
q 1. Attach cardiac monitor, End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2).
q 2. Assemble device according to manufacturer procedure. Attach supplemental Oxygen per manufacturer procedure.
q 3. Verbally instruct patient and coach breathing with the device.
 Patient must be able to follow commands and interact with EMS Provider to use this tool effectively.
q 4. Instruct patient to slowly breathe in through the nose and exhale through the mouth .
 Inhalation to exhalation ratio should be roughly 4:1.
q 5. Set positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 5cmH₂O.
q 6. Secure mask in place with head strap.
q 7. Reassess patient and titrate PEEP to desired effect, per protocol.
q 8. Record and monitor vital signs, EtCO2, and SpO2 frequently.
 Changes in patient condition, patient complaint or clinical picture should all result in repeat of full VS and documentation.
q 9. In the event of worsening respiratory status after initiation of CPAP:
 Evaluate patient compliance and offer reassurance, verbal coaching if appropriate.
 Remove CPAP mask and stop treatment if patient unable to tolerate CPAP OR if clinically deteriorating.
 Institute BLS and ALS care per appropriate protocol.
 Document adverse reactions, and reasons why CPAP was discontinued in electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
Consider CPAP protocol if:
q Tachypnea, nasal flaring, subcostal/intercostal retractions, tracheal tugging
q Suspected bronchospasm on clinical exam
q Rales suggesting pulmonary edema and patient with history of congestive heart failure (CHF) or renal insufficiency
q Respiratory rate >25 per minute
q Oxygen saturation <93% on high flow Oxygen
Contraindications
q Respiratory Arrest
q Agonal Respirations
q Unconsciousness or obtundation
q Shock associated with cardiac insufficiency
q Persistent nausea and vomiting
q Facial anomalies or trauma
q Inability to cooperate with the procedure
q Current tracheostomy
