Capnography - Procedures
Nasal End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2)
Procedure:
q 1. Attach capnography tubing to device
q 2. Attach tubing to patient (may supplement with NRB mask if needed)
q 3. Record readings initially and throughout treatment as with other vital signs
q 4. Document the procedure and results on/with the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR)
Advanced Airway End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2)
Procedure:
q 1. Attach capnography sensor to Advanced Airway.
q 2. Note CO2 level and waveform.
q 3. Record readings on scene, en route to the hospital and upon patient delivery to receiving facility.
q 4. Any loss of EtCO2 detection of waveform indicates an airway problem – recheck tube placement and remove if appropriate
q 5. End-tidal CO2 goal is 40mmHg
 Above 45mmHg, increase ventilation rate
 Below 35mmHg, slow down ventilation rate
q 6. Document the procedure and results on/with the Patient Care Report (PCR)
