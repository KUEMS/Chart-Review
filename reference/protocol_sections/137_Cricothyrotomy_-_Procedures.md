Cricothyrotomy - Procedures
 When all airway interventions have failed and the patient needs a secure airway immediately, consider performing cricothyrotomy. The
percutaneous approach is preferred to the open.
 If the patient is not able to be ventilated via BVM, ETT or BIAD and the Paramedic feels a surgical airway is necessary, Medical Control
should be contacted first. If time and situation do not allow it, this Procedure may be completed prior to authorization by Medical Control.
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q 14 gauge or larger IV catheter
q Needle
q 10 mL syringe
q Adapter from a 3.0mm ETT
q Saline
q Alcohol pad
q 4x4 gauze pad
q Tape
q Suction
Procedure:
q 1. Position patient supine in the sniffing position with slight extension of the neck – identify landmarks of the cricothyroid membrane by
palpation utilizing anatomical landmarks (below the thyroid cartilage and above the cricoid cartilage).
q 2. Cleanse anterior neck
q 3. Fill a 10mL syringe with 5mL of 0.9% Normal Saline
q 4. Remove dilator from the package and sheath and advance into the tracheostomy tube
q 5. Insert the splitting needle perpendicular to the skin and cricothyroid membrane while gently holding negative pressure and as pirating
with the syringe. Upon entering the trachea there will be a loss of resistance and free flow of air with bubbles flowing easily into the
syringe.
q 6. Drop the angle of the needle > 45 degrees and aim the tip of the needle toward carina (toward the feet) and complete insertion of
needle, while continuing to aspirateto ensure the needle remains in the trachea.
q 7. While stabilizing the needle in place, disconnect the needle form the syringe and advance guidewire (attached to the dilator) into the
hub of the splitting needle until resistance is met.
q 8. Squeeze wings of needle together. The needle should split in half and allow the guidewire/dilator to be advanced.
q 9. When the dilator meets resistance at the skin, remove the needle by pulling in opposite directions, while securing the guidewire in the
trachea and the dilator at the skin.
q 10. Place thumb on dilator knob while first and second fingers are curved under flange of trachea tube . With gentle, continuous
pressure, advance the dilator and tracheostomy tube into position until flange is secure against the skin.
q 11. Remove dilator and inflate cuff until device is secure in the airway (max 5mL).
q 12. Attach EtCO2 and BVM.
q 13. Secure tube in place using the provided twill tape behind the neck of the patient.
q 14. Confirm placement with gentle ventilation via BVM, continuous digital waveform capnography, and physical exam. Be sure air
movement is fluid with bilateral symmetric chest rise and that no visible neck or soft-tissue distortion is noted
q 15. If tracheal placement is unclear, remove device and transport immediately to the closest Emergency Department.
q 16. Consider Sedation Protocol as appropriate.
q 17. If not previously done, immediately contact receiving facility and Medical Control
