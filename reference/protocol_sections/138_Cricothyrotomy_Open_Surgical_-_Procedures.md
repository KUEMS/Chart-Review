Cricothyrotomy (Open) Surgical - Procedures
Clinical Indication:
q Failed airway management when standard airway procedures cannot be performed or have failed in an adult patient that requires airway
management.
q Upper airway obstruction (eg. facial or neck trauma occluding airway patency, foreign body unable to be removed, angioedema) and
inability to adequately oxygenate and ventilate using less invasive methods.
q If Possible Contact Medical Control Before Proceeding. If not possible, notify receiving hospital as soon as possible.
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q Scalpel
q Antiseptic swab
q 6.0 mm endotracheal tube
q 10cmL syringe
q Tracheal hook (if available)
q Bougie device
q Continuous Digital Waveform Capnography
Procedure:
q 1. Have suction and supplies available and ready.
q 2. Position patient supine in the sniffing position with slight extension of the neck – identify landmarks of the cricothyroid membrane by
palpation utilizing anatomical landmarks (below the thyroid cartilage and above the cricoid cartilage).
q 3. Prep the area with an antiseptic swab.
q 4. Using the non-dominant hand, spread the overlying skin taut with the thumb and fingers, and slightly depress the skin over the
cricothyroid membrane with the index finger to mark the site of cricothyrotomy. Do not release the non-dominant hand from the neck
until the procedure is complete. Once the anatomy is found and defined, avoid movement of the anatomy to promote proper
cricothyrotomy airway placement.
q 5. Using a sterile scalpel, make a vertical incision in the mid-line of the neck extending from just above the lower edge of the thyroid
cartilage to the middle of the cricoid cartilage. Make the depth of this incision sufficient to extend through the skin and fatty tissue
underneath.
q 6. Using the same scalpel, make a short horizontal incision in the middle of the cricothyroid membrane into the trachea.
 If a tracheal hook is available: prior to removing scalpel from incision, use a tracheal hook to pull anterior and inferior on the thyroid
cartilage (lower edge of horizontal incision). Exercise caution when manipulating the tracheal hook into the incision – the tip of most
tracheal hooks is particularly sharp-edged.
 If tracheal hook is not available: a bougie device should be used as introducer into the tracheal opening prior to passing the ET tube.
q 7. Pass a 6.0mm Endotracheal Tube through the horizontal incision in the cricothyroid membrane , angling the tube inferior and
posterior along the tracheal anatomy.
q 8. Inflate the endotracheal cuff with 5-10mL of air and verify airway placement with EtCO2 (continuous digital capnography
monitoring) and physical exam (chest rise, breath sounds).
q 9. Confirm placement with gentle ventilation via BVM, continuous digital waveform capnography, and physical exam. Be sure
air movement is fluid with bilateral symmetric chest rise and that no visible neck or soft-tissue distortion is noted
q 10. If tracheal placement is unclear, remove device and transport immediately to the closest Emergency Department.
q 11. Consider Sedation Protocol as appropriate.
q 12. If not previously done, immediately contact receiving facility and Medical Control
q 13. Continually monitor for respiratory changes during transport, especially after any patient movement/transfers.
q 14. Monitor for complications (ie hemorrhage, expanding neck hematoma, dislodgement).
q 15. Document procedure.
Contraindications:
q Ability to oxygenate and ventilate using less invasive
methods.
q Pediatric Patients
q Suspected fractured larynx and/or cricoid cartilage
q Suspected tracheal transection
q Inability to find anatomical landmarks
