Control-Cric - Procedures
 When all airway interventions have failed and the patient needs a secure airway immediately, consider performing cricothyrotomy. The
percutaneous approach is preferred to the open.
 If the patient is not able to be ventilated via BVM, ETT or BIAD and the Paramedic feels a surgical airway is necessary, Medical Control
should be contacted first. If time and situation do not allow it, this Procedure may be completed prior to authorization by Medical Control.
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q Control-Cric Kit
q Alcohol pad
q 4x4 gauze pad
q Tape
q Suction
Procedure:
q 1. Position patient supine in the sniffing position with slight extension of the neck – identify landmarks of the cricothyroid membrane by
palpation utilizing anatomical landmarks (below the thyroid cartilage and above the cricoid cartilage).
q 2. Cleanse anterior neck
q 3. If Right-Handed, operator should be positioned on the right side of the patient; if Left-Handed, operator should be positioned
on the left. Operator should stabilize the larynx with the thumb and middle finger of non-dominant hand. Identify the
cricothyroid membrane, typically 4 finger breadths below the mandible and 3 finger breadths above the sternal notch.
q 4. Use the Cric-Knife to incise the skin. A vertical incision should be made initially to allow positive identification of the
cricothyroid membrane. Once the cricothyroid membrane has been identified, rotate the knife horizontally and make a single,
perpendicular “plunge” incision through the membrane.
q 5. Once the horizontal incision is made, maintain downward pressure on the knife; do NOT remove knife from the tracheal opening. Slide
the attached tracheal hook through the newly formed stoma until it “pops” through the cricothyroid membrane and stops against the
posterior wall of the trachea. With your non-dominant hand, grab the handle of the tracheal hook and pull back on the thyroid
cartilage to hold stable placement.
q 6. While maintaining traction with the trach hook, insert the Cric-Key through the incision. Confirmation of proper placement can be
made by moving the Cric-Key along the anterior wall of the trachea and feeling the tracheal rings with the device . Once correct
placement is obtained, insert the Cric-Key tube down to level of the flange. Flange should rest on the patient’s anterior neck.
q 7. Rotate the Cric-Key towards patient shoulder and retract to remove from airway .
q 8. Firmly stabilize the Cric-Key tube and remove the Cric-Key introducer with slow, steady pull. Inflate the cuff until resistance is met.
q 9. Ventilate with BVM and 100% O2.
q 10. Confirm placement with gentle ventilation via BVM, continuous digital waveform capnography, and physical exam. Be sure air
movement is fluid with bilateral symmetric chest rise and that no visible neck or soft-tissue distortion is noted.
q 11. Secure tube with supplied tube holder.
q 12. Observe for subcutaneous air, which may indicate tracheal injury or extra-tracheal tube position.
q 13. If tracheal placement is unclear, remove device and transport immediately to the closest Emergency Department.
q 14. Consider Sedation Protocol as appropriate.
q 15. If not previously done, immediately contact receiving facility and Medical Control
