Needle Jet Insufflation - Procedures
 When all airway interventions have failed and the patient needs oxygenation immediately, consider performing needle jet insufflation.
 If the patient is not able to be ventilated via BVM, ETT or BIAD and the Paramedic feels needle jet insufflation is necessary, Medical Control
should be contacted first. If time and situation do not allow it, this Procedure may be completed prior to authorization by Medical Control.
Clinical Indications:
Life threatening upper airway obstruction where all other BLS and ALS maneuvers and techniques have failed .
Procedure:
q 1. Use personal protective equipment, including gloves, gown and mask as indicated.
q 2. Locate the cricothyroid membrane and prep the area with antiseptic wipe
q 3. Extend the neck to bring the cricothyroid membrane anterior and as close to the skin as possible
q 4. Insert the #10 gauge angiocath through the membrane at 90° to the skin until loss of resistance
 Use a 3mL syringe and apply negative pressure to confirm free aspiration of air and needle presence in the trachea
 Consider using a second angiocath through the same insertion site if first needle becomes occluded during procedure
q 5. Drop the angle of the needle to approximately 60° with the tip aimed toward the patient’s feet
 Continue negative pressure on the syringe to confirm continued placement in the trachea
q 6. Attach the 7.0 Endotracheal Tube BVM adapter to the end of the syringe
q 7. Ventilate at a ratio of 1:5 inhalation:exhalation
q 8. If the airway resistance continues to increase, disconnect the BVM to allow for exhalation
 Consider addition of second angiocath for use as an exhalation port
q 9. If subcutaneous emphysema develops, stop insufflation and remove angiocath
 Repeat steps 2-7 as above
q 10. Notify the receiving facility of Failed Airway Protocol use and need for Needle Jet Insufflation.
q 11. Document the procedure and patient response to care in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
