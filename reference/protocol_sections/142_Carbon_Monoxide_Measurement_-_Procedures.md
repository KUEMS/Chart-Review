Carbon Monoxide Measurement - Procedures
Procedure:
q 1. Apply probe to patient’s digit(s) as recommended by the manufacturer. If near strobe lights, cover the finger to avoid
interference and/or move away from the lights if possible. Where the manufacturer provides a light shield it should be used.
q 2. Allow machine to register percent circulating carboxyhemoglobin values
q 3. Verify pulse rate on machine with palpated pulse of the patient
q 4. Record levels in electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR) or on the scene rehabilitation form
 If CO <5%, assess for other possible illness or injury
 If CO >5% to <15% and symptomatic from Carbon Monoxide – treat per Carbon Monoxide Exposure Protocol
 If CO >15% - treat per Carbon Monoxide Exposure Protocol
Signs and symptoms of Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning – altered mental status, dizziness, headache, nausea/vomiting, chest pain,
respiratory distress, neurological impairments, vision problems, reddened eyes, tachycardia, tachypnea, arrhythmias, seizures and/or coma.
q 5. Monitor critical patients continuously with continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2) and SpCO until arrival at the hospital.
q 6. Document percent of carboxyhemoglobin values every time vital signs are recorded during therapy for exposed patients.
q 7. Use the SpO2 feature of the device as an added tool for patient evaluation. Treat the patient, not the data provided by the
device. Utilize the relevant protocol for guidance.
q 8. The SpO2 reading should never be used to withhold oxygen from a patient with respiratory distress or complaining of shortness of
breath.
q 9. Factors which may reduce the reliability of the reading include:
 Poor peripheral circulation (hypovolemia, hypotension, hypothermia).
 Excessive external lighting, particularly strobe/flashing lights
 Excessive sensor motion.
 Fingernail polish (should be removed with acetone pad).
 Irregular heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation, SVT, etc.).
 Jaundice.
 Placement of BP cuff on same extremity as SpO2 probe.
CO poisoning can look a lot like influenza, particularly in the winter months. Have a high index of suspicion when seeing multiple patients
from the same environment with flu-like illnesses and consider Carbon Monoxide.
