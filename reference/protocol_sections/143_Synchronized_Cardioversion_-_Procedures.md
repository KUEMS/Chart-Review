Synchronized Cardioversion - Procedures
Procedure:
q 1. Ensure the patient is attached properly to a cardiac monitor/defibrillator capable of synchronized cardioversion.
q 2. Have all equipment prepared for unsynchronized cardioversion/defibrillation, if the patient fails synchronized cardioversion and/or the
clinical condition worsens.
q 3. Firmly apply defib pads to patients chest – assure it is clean, dry, with minimal chest hair.
q 4. Consider the use of Sedation Protocol, as appropriate.
q 5. Set energy selection to the appropriate setting, per Protocol.
q 6. Set monitor/defibrillator to synchronized cardioversion mode, per manufacturer’s instructions.
q 7. Make certain all personnel are clear of the patient.
q 8. PRESS and HOLD the “Shock” button to deploy the charge and cardiovert. Stay clear of the patient until you are certain the energy has
been delivered.
 NOTE: It may take the monitor/defibrillator several cardiac cycles to “synchronize”, so there may be a delay between activating the
cardioversion and the actual delivery of energy.
q 9. Note patient response – immediately refer to Appropriate Cardiac Dysrhythmia Protocol.
 Document patient response to intervention, VS and clinical condition as situation permits.
q 10. Repeat per protocol until maximum setting or until efforts successful.
q 11. Note procedure, response, and times in electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
