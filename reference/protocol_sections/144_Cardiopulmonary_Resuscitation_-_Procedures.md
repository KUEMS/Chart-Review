Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation - Procedures
Procedure:
q 1. Check for responsiveness and feel for a pulse
 Carotid pulse for adults and older children, brachial or femoral pulse for infant
q 2. If compressions are ongoing on EMS arrival, evaluate rate and depth while attaching the Cardiac Monitor OR AED
 If compressions adequate, charge the monitor for rhythm analysis and shock evaluation immediately if appropriate OR begin AED
analysis
 If no compressions OR felt to be inadequate, initiate high quality chest compressions at >100 compressions per minute for two
minutes.
q 3. Open the patient’s airway
 Head-tilt, chin-lift technique if no head or neck trauma suspected
 Jaw-thrust if head or neck trauma suspected or unknown
q 4. For arrests without advanced airway, perform compressions:breaths as age appropriate
 Once advanced airway established, transition to >100 compressions per minute uninterrupted with 8-10 breaths per minute.
q 5. At first rhythm analysis:
 If shock advised by AED or interpreted as V-fib / Pulseless V-tach, defibrillate and notify dispatch of first defibrillation time.
 If no shock advised by AED or interpreted to be non-shockable, discard shock and continue.
q 6. At 2 minutes if no response to resuscitation, consider advanced airway placement (BIAD or ETT) if situation and clinical
presentation appropriate.
 If good chest rise and air exchange achieved, it is acceptable to continue BVM with an airway adjunct (NPA or OPA)
q 7. Begin charging the monitor to prepare for defibrillation approximately 20 seconds before the 2 minute mark
q 8. At every 2 minute mark (200 chest compressions)
 Rotate compressors (as allowed by personnel on scene)
 Perform a rhythm and pulse check.
q If V-fib / Pulseless V-tach, deliver shock as per Appropriate Cardiac Arrest Protocol
 Medications delivered after shock as per Appropriate Cardiac Arrest Protocol
q If no shockable rhythm, safely dump pending charge to prevent negligent discharge and/or responder injury.
 Medications delivered after decision as per Appropriate Cardiac Arrest Protocol
q 9. Resume compressions at 100 per minute, ventilations at 8-10 breaths per minute (as age appropriate if no advanced airway).
 Minimize interruptions in chest compressions as much as possible.
q 10. Repeat steps 7-9 until change in patient condition or decision made to terminate resuscitation after 20 minutes (4 rounds of
ACLS medications)
q 11. Contact Medical Control as needed for orders or with any questions.
