High Performance CPR - Procedures
High Performance CPR is a basis for increasing communication and efficiency during resuscitation of a cardiac arrest. It is based on four guiding principles taken from proven
tactics developed by The Resuscitation Academy in Seattle, WA:
q 1. “BLS owns CPR” - focusing on fundamentals, predetermined roles, coordinated movement and minimized interruptions WILL improve outcomes
q 2. “It isn’t complicated, but it isn’t easy.” Standardizing care across EMS systems takes time but ultimately improves efficiency and patient outcomes.
q 3. “Measure, improve, measure, improve...” - tracking our survival rates and making incremental improvements WILL have enormous effects
q 4. “Everyone in V-Fib survives” - If we can get to patients who are in shockable rhythms – OR use HPCPR to get them back to shockable – plan on getting ROSC!
2 Person Resuscitation Crew
#1 – Compressor (Patient Right)
q Checks Pulse - <10 seconds
q Immediately starts CPR (100-120 / minute)
q 30:2 Compressions:Ventilations
q Don’t pause compressions until #2 (Airway) ready
#2 – AED / Airway (Patient Left)
q Applies pads without interrupting compressions
q Operates AED / Monitor (if manual, charge at 1min45sec)
q Manages Airway – OPA with BVM
 (Advanced Airway placed at 6minutes or as resources
allow) 1
q Alternates with Compressor every 2 minutes

Procedures
BLS owns CPR – depth 2-2.4 inches, rate 100-120 compressions minute, rock palms to allow chest recoil, rotate in <5 sec, hover hands during shock delivery
Eliminate ALL unneccessary interruptions in compressions – coordination and communication among expert resuscitationists, count down the last 15sec
Controlled ventilations – 1 second breath delivery, 350-500mL (just enough for chest rise); with advanced airway, 1 breath every 10sec (6x/min) with same volume
AED / Monitor integration – begin charges BEFORE rhythm / pulse check to defibrillate ASAP, hover hands to keep compression delays to a minimum
Metronome always on for cardiac arrests, set to 110bpm
At 6 minutes or as soon as practical, apply mechanical CPR device; monitor for migration of device, particularly before/after patient movement
