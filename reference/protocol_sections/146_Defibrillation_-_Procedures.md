Defibrillation - Procedures
Automated
Procedure:
q 1. If multiple rescuers available, one rescuer should provide uninterrupted chest compressions while the AED is being prepared for use
q 2. Remove any medication patches on the chest and wipe off any residue
q 3. Apply defibrillator pads per manufacturer recommendations. Use alternate placement when implanted devices (pacemakers, AICDs)
occupy preferred pad positions (front/back or shifted slightly to not rest on the implanted device).
q 4. If necessary, connect defibrillator leads, per manufacturer recommendations
q 5. Activate AED for analysis of rhythm
q 6. Stop chest compressions and clear the patient for rhythm analysis. Keep interruption in chest compressions as brief as possible
q 7. Assertively state “CLEAR” and visualize that no one, including yourself, is in contact with the patient prior to defibrillation.
q 8. Defibrillate if appropriate by depressing the “shock” button. Biphasic defibrillators will determine the correct joules
accordingly
q 9. Continue to follow protocol
q 10. Record the time and result of the analysis in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
Manual
Procedure:
q 1. If multiple rescuers available, one rescuer should provide uninterrupted chest compressions while the Monitor is being prepared for
use
q 2. Remove any medication patches on the chest and wipe off any residue
q 3. Apply defibrillator pads per manufacturer recommendations. Use alternate placement when implanted devices (pacemakers, AICDs)
occupy preferred pad positions (front/back or shifted slightly to not rest on the implanted device). Refer to pictures for pediatric
placement.
q 4. If necessary, connect defibrillator leads, per manufacturer recommendations
q 5. Charge the defibrillator per protocol. Continue chest compressions while the defibrillator is charging
q 6. Pause chest compressions and determine if shockable after reviewing rhythm for max of 5 seconds.
q 7. Assertively state “CLEAR” and visualize that no one, including yourself, is in contact with the patient prior to defibrillation.
q 8. Defibrillate if appropriate by depressing the “shock” button.
q 9. If non-shockable discard the shock, per manufacturer recommendations
q 10. Continue to follow protocol
q 11. Record the time and result of the analysis in the patient care report (PCR).
