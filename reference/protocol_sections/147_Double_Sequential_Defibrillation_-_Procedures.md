Double Sequential Defibrillation - Procedures
Clinical Indications:
q Patients with refractory or recurrent ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) or shockable rhythm per AED
analysis that has not responded to >3 standard defibrillation attempts.
Procedure:
q 1. Ensure all necessary cardiac arrest interventions have been applied up to this point.
 Uninterrupted and effective CPR.
 Defibrillation at maximum output for at least three rounds of shocks (including first responder AED shocks, if applicable).
 Administration of Amiodarone 300mg.
 Consideration of other possible causes of cardiac arrest.
q 2. Upon decision to attempt Double Sequential Defibrillation, the first set of pads should be removed from the patient
q 3. Apply the manual defibrillator in the parasternal / axillary positions as shown in the figure below (blue pads)
 The first rhythm check after moving the pads should be completed as a single shock, as previous
q 4. Apply an AED in the anterior / posterior positions as shown in the figure below (red pads)
 Assure that the two sets of pads do not contact one another
q 3. Select maximum energy setting for both devices. Charge devices in advance of the anticipated break in CPR and ensure chest
compressions continue while both devices are being charged.
q 4. At next rhythm analysis, if patient remains in ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) OR shock
advised by AED:
 Clear patient.
 Deliver double sequential defibrillation by having two operators depressing both “Shock” buttons simultaneously.
q 5. Once criteria are met for dual sequential defibrillation, all subsequent shocks delivered shall be using this method.
NOTE:
q There is the potential to cause damage to equipment when performing this procedure . Therefore, it is recommended that attempts be
made to perform Double Sequential Defibrillation using an AED in combination with a monitor to reduce risk .
q The case reports of equipment failure have not indicated the mechanism of damage; the steps above are an attempt to improve patient
outcome while mitigating risk, but have not been proven to change outcomes.
q Because of the potential for adverse equipment results, it is important that your Service Director and Medical Director approve this
procedure BEFORE attempting.
q Devices used for Double Sequential Defibrillation should be removed from service until a full evaluation and function check can be
completed to ensure safety of subsequent patients.
