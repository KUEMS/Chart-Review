External Cardiac Pacing - Procedures
Procedure:
q 1. Attach standard cardiac monitor.
q 2. Apply defibrillation/pacing pads per manufacturer recommendations.
 One pad to left mid chest next to sternum, one pad to left mid posterior back next to spine.
q 3. Place monitor into pacing mode, as specified by manufacturer.
q 4. Adjust heart rate to 70bpm for an adult, 100bpm for pediatric patients.
q 5. Note pacer spikes on EKG screen.
q 6. Slowly increase output until capture of electrical rhythm is noted on the monitor.
q 7. If unable to capture while at maximum current output, stop pacing immediately.
q 8. If capture observed on monitor, check for corresponding pulse and assess vital signs.
q 9. Mechanical capture occurs when paced electrical spikes on the monitor correspond with palpable pulse .
q 10. Consider Sedation Protocol as appropriate.
q 11. Document the dysrhythmia and the response to external pacing with ECG strips in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
