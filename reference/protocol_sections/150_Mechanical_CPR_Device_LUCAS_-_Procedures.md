Mechanical CPR Device (LUCAS) - Procedures
Procedure Continued:
q 13. Adjust the height of the compression arm
q 14. Use the two fingers (V pattern) to make sure that the lower edge of the Suction Cup is immediately above the end of the sternum.
If necessary, move the device by pulling the support legs to adjust the position
q 15. Press the Adjust Mode Button on the control pad labeled #1 (this will allow you to easily adjust the height of the compression arm)
q 16. To adjust the start position of the compression arm, manually push down the SUCTION CUP with two fingers onto the chest (without
compressing the patient’s chest)
q 17. Once the position of the compression arm is satisfactory, push the green PAUSE button labeled #2 (This will lock the arm in this
positon), then remove your fingers from the SUCTION CUP
q 18. If the position is incorrect, press the ADJUST MODE BUTTON and repeat the steps
q 19. Start Compressions
q 20. If the patient in not intubated and you will be providing compression to ventilation ratio of 30:2 push ACTIVE (30:2) button to
start
q 21. If the patient is intubated and you will be providing continuous compressions push ACTIVE (continuous) button
q 22. Place the neck roll behind the patient’s head and attach the straps to the LUCAS device (this will prevent the LUCAS from migrating
toward the patient's feet
q 23. Place the patients arms in the straps provided
-Defibrillation can and should be performed with the LUCAS device in place and in operation
-One may apply the defibrillation electrodes either before or after the LUCAS device has been put in position
-The pads and wires should not be underneath the suction cup
-If the electrodes are already in an incorrect position when the LUCAS is placed, you must apply new electrodes
-If the rhythm strip cannot be assessed during compressions, one may stop the compressions for analysis by pushing the PAUSE BUTTON (The
duration of interruption of compressions should be kept as short as possible and should not be > 10 seconds. There is no need to interrupt
chest compressions other than to analyze the rhythm).
-Once the rhythm is determined to require defibrillation, the appropriate ACTIVE BUTTON should be pushed to resume compressions while the
defibrillator is charging and then the defibrillator should be discharged .
