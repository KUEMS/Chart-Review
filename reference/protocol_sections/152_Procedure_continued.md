Procedure (continued):
q 5. Slide the AutoPulse device behind the patient and lower the patient down onto the device , centering the supine patient with the
armpits just above the YELLOW line
q 6. Locate mating slot of band 2 and place on top of band 1 already on chest. Press the bands together to engage and secure the Velcro
fastener. Make sure the bands are not twisted
 If bands cannot be closed, use manual chest compressions instead
q 7. Press and release the START/CONTINUE button once. The AutoPulse automatically adjusts the band to the patient’s chest and
determined the appropriate compression
 Do not touch the patient or the LifeBand CCA while the AutoPulse is analyzing the patient’s size
q 8. Verify the patient is properly aligned and that the LifeBand CCA has taken up any slack in the bands
q 9, Press the START/CONTINUE button a second time to start compression cycles and the AutoPulse will begin chest compression cycles
q 10. Set the mode to either the pre-set compression-to-ventilations or continuous compressions option
q 11. Continue to monitor the placement of the patient on the AutoPulse after moving the patient or during transport to ensure prop er
alignment. Using Zoll approved restraints to secure the patient to the platform is recommended.
q NOTE: Do not stop the device for more than 10 seconds after at least 2 minutes of compressions per American Heart Association’s (AHA)
CPR guidelines. Intravenous cannulation, endotracheal intubation, or any other procedure should either be attempted during chest
compressions or during the 10 second pause. Approved alternatives to those procedures, such as intraosseous infusion and a BLS airway
(example: King Tube) should be considered. Cardiac defibrillation should be attempted during a 10 second pause.
