Chest Decompression - Procedures
164
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q 14 gauge 2–2.5 inch over the needle catheter
q Tape
q Sterile Gauze Pads
q Antiseptic swabs
q Occlusive dressing
Procedure:
q 1. Locate landmarks for needle decompression
 Site A - 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line on the same side as the pneumothorax
 Site B – 4th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line on the same side as the pneumothorax (Adult ONLY)
 (This is a relatively NEW location for Prehospital Providers and requires familiarity with the anatomy, practice and appropriate
credentialing)
 BE AWARE of and avoid underlying anatomical structures in the chest (lung, heart, vasculature) as well as abdominal organs that
move significantly with respiration (spleen, liver, intestine, vasculature).
q 2. Prepare the site with an antiseptic swab
q 3. Firmly introduce catheter immediately above superior edge of rib at selected site
 Remember: the neurovascular bundle (nerve, artery and vein) run under the inferior edge of the ribs)
q 4. Insert the needle perpendicular to the skin with downward pressure until there is a loss of resistance and a return of air .
q 5. Advance the needle another 1/8", to ensure the catheter is inside the thoracic cavity.
 Hold the catheter in place with one hand while removing the needle and disposing of sharps in container .
q 6. Secure the catheter taking care not to allow it to kink
 If time and situation allow, use an occlusive dressing to cover the catheter and tape on 3 sides to create a one-way valve.
q 7. Reassess lung sounds, pulses, tracheal deviation and patient clinical condition
q 8. Dress area with occlusive dressing then cover with sterile gauze pad
q 9. Reassess breath sounds and respiratory status
q 10. Document Procedure, patient response, VS and change in clinical condition in the electronic Patient Care Report
