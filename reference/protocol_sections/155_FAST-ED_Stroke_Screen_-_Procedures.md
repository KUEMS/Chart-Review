FAST-ED Stroke Screen - Procedures
Procedure:
q 1. Assess and treat suspected stroke patients as per protocol (p64)
q 2. Establish the “time last normal” for the patient. This will be the presumed time of onset.
q 3. The FAST-ED Stroke Screen may be considered for all stroke patients with suspected Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO)
 Patients who are likely to have a LVO may benefit from transport to a Comprehensive Stroke Center
q 4. Perform the screen through physical exam:
 Look for facial palsy by asking the patient to smile
 Have patient, while sitting upright or standing, extend both arms parallel to floor, close eyes, and turn their palms upward. Assess for
unilateral weakness or drift of an arm.
 Have the person say, “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks”, or some other simple, familiar saying. Assess for the person to slur the
words, get some words wrong, or inability to speak.
 Ask the patient to look in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Assess for the ability of the pupil to cross midline
 Assess the patient’s ability to interpret stimulus from both sides of the body.
q 5. Add up the patient score from the table (below). A score of 4 or greater has a 60-85% prediction of a large vessel occlusion
q 6. Evaluate Blood Glucose level
q 7. If the “time last normal” is <12 hours, blood glucose is between 60 and 400, and the patient has a score of 4 or greater, consider the
clinical presentation of the patient
 Patients with unstable VS or emergent airway needs should go to the closest appropriate facility
 Patients who are clinically stable and suspected LVO, consider transport directly to a Comprehensive Stroke Center.
 Alert the receiving hospital with Stroke Alert and FAST-ED score as early as possible.
q 8. The complete screening should be documented in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
