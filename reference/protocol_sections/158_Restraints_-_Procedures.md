Restraints - Procedures
Any patient who may harm himself, herself or others may be gently restrained to prevent injury to the patient or crew.
This restraint must be in a humane manner and used only as a last resort. Other means to prevent injury to the patient
or crew must be attempted first. These efforts could include reality orientation, distraction techniques, or other less
restrictive therapeutic means. Physical or chemical restraint should be a last resort technique
Procedure:
q 1. The least restrictive means of managing the patient should always be employed first.
q 2. Ensure that there are sufficient personnel available to restrain the patient safely.
q 3. Restrain the patient in a lateral or supine position. No devices such as backboards, splints or other devices will be on top of the
patient.
q 4. The patient will never be restrained in the prone position.
q 5. The patient must be under constant observation by the EMS crew at all times. This includes direct visualization of the patient as well
as continuous cardiac, pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring as indicated.
q 6. The extremities that are restrained will have a circulation check at least every 15 minutes. The first of these checks should occur as
soon after placement of the restraints as possible. This MUST be documented in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
q 7. If the above actions are unsuccessful, or if the patient is resisting the restraints, consider chemical restraint per protocol.
q 8. IF a patient is restrained by law enforcement personnel with handcuffs or other devices EMS personnel cannot remove , a law
enforcement officer must accompany the patient to the hospital in the transporting EMS vehicle
q 9. Consider Behavioral Emergencies Protocol.
q 10. Restraining a patient in the prone position is never authorized.
