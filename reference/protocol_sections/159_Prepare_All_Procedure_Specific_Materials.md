# Section 159: Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:

---

Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q Backboard
q Straps
q C-collar appropriate for patient size
q Tape and/or Head Rolls
Procedure:
q 1. Explain the procedure to the patient.
q 2. Apply an appropriately sized c-collar while maintaining in-line stabilization of the c-spine.
 This stabilization, to be provided by a second rescuer, should not involve traction or tension but rather simply maintaining the head in
a neutral, midline position while the first rescuer applies the collar.
 This may be performed by any credentialed responder if indicated by protocol.
q 3. Once the collar is secure, the second rescuer should continue to maintain inline neutral position to ensure stabilization.
 The collar is helpful but will not do the job by itself.
q 4. If the patient is supine or prone, consider the log roll technique. For the patient in a vehicle or otherwise unable to be placed prone or
supine, place them on the backboard by the safest method available that maximizes maintenance of in-line spinal stability
q 5. Stabilize the patient with straps and head rolls/tape or other similar device. Once the head is secured to the backboard, the second
rescuer may release manual in-line stabilization.
q 6. NOTE: some patients , due to size or age, will not be able to be immobilized through in-line stabilization with standard
backboards and c-collars. Never force a patient into a non-neutral position to immobilize them. Such situations may require a second
rescuer to maintain manual stabilization throughout the transport to the hospital.
q 7. Document the time of the procedure in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
