# Section 160: EMS Providers must use extreme caution when evaluating and treating an injured p

---

EMS Providers must use extreme caution when evaluating and treating an injured player, especially when the
extent of the injury remains unknown Suspect any unconscious football player to have an accompanying spinal
injury until proven otherwise. If the player isn’t breathing or the possibility of respiratory arrest exists, its
essential that certified athletic trainers and EMS providers work quickly and effectively to remove the face mask
and administer care. In most situations, the helmet should not be removed in the field. Proper management of
head and neck injuries includes leaving the helmet and shoulder pads in place whenever possible , removing only
the face mask from the helmet and developing a plan to manage head-and-neck injured players using welltrained sports medicine and EMS providers.
Guidelines and Recommendations:
The following guidelines and recommendations were developed by the Inter-Association Task Force for the appropriate Care of the SpineInjured Athlete:
q 1. General Guidelines for Care Prior to Arrival of EMS
 The Emergency Medical Services system should be activated
 Any athlete suspected of having a spinal injury should not be moved and should be managed as though a spinal injury exists.
 The athlete’s airway, breathing and circulation, neurological status and level of consciousness should be assessed
 The athlete should NOT be moved unless absolutely essential to maintain airway , breathing and circulation
 If the athlete must be moved to maintain airway, breathing and circulation, the athlete should be placed in a supine position while
maintaining spinal immobilization.
 When moving a suspected spine injured athlete, the head and trunk should be moved as a unit. One accepted technique is to manually
splint the head to the trunk.
q 2. Face Mask Removal
 The face mask should be removed prior to transportation, regardless of current respiratory status (see figure 1)
 Those involved in the pre-hospital care of injured players must have the tools for face mask removal readily available .
Indications for Helmet Removal:
q 1. The athletic helmet and chin straps should only be removed if:
 The helmet and chin strap do not hold the head securely, such that immobilization of the helmet does not also immobilize the head
 The design of the helmet and chin strap is such that even after removal of the face mask the airway cannot be controlled, or ventilation
be provided.
 The face mask cannot be removed after a reasonable period of time
 The helmet prevents immobilization from transporting in an appropriate position .
Helmet Removal:
q 1. If it becomes absolutely necessary, spinal immobilization must be maintained while removed the helmet
 Helmet removal should be frequently practiced under proper supervision by an EMS supervisor or Training Division staff
 Due to the varying types of helmets encountered, the helmet should be removed with close oversight by the team athletic trainers
and/or sports medicine staff
 In most circumstances, it may be helpful to remove cheek padding and/or deflate air padding prior to helmet removal.
Spinal Alignment:
q 1. Appropriate spinal alignment must be maintained during care and transport using backboard, straps, tape, head blocks or other
necessary equipment.
 Be aware that the helmet and shoulder pads elevate an athlete’s trunk when in the supine position
 Should either be removed, or if only one is present, appropriate spinal alignment must be maintained.
 The front of the shoulder pads can be opened to allow access for CPR and defibrillation
