Splinting - Procedures
Clinical Indications:
q Immobilization of an extremity for transport due to suspected fracture, sprain or other traumatic injury
q Immobilization of an extremity for transport to secure medically necessary devices such as IV catheter
Procedure:
q 1. Assess and document pulses, sensation and motor function prior to placement of the splint. If no pulses are present and a fracture is
suspected, consider reduction of the fracture prior to placement of the splint.
 If extended scene time, prolonged extrication and pulseless extremity, contact Medical Control for recommendations
q 2. Remove all clothing from the extremity.
q 3. Select a site to secure the splint both proximal and distal to the area of suspected injury or the area where the medical dev ice will be
placed.
q 4. Do not secure the splint directly over the injury.
q 5. Place the splint and secure with Velcro, straps, or bandage material (ie. Kling, kerlex, cloth bandage, etc.) depending on the splint
manufacturer and design.
q 6. Document pulses, sensation and motor function after placement of the splint. If there has been a deterioration in any of these 3
parameters, reposition the splint and reassess. If no improvement, remove splint.
q 7. IF a femur fracture is suspected and there is no evidence of pelvic fracture or instability, place a traction splint.
q 8. Consider pain management per Pain Management Protocol.
q 9. Document the time, type of splint, and the pre and post assessment of pulse, sensation and motor function in the electronic
Patient Care Report (ePCR).
