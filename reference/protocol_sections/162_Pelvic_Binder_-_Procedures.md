Pelvic Binder - Procedures
Clinical Indications:
q High Energy Mechanism such as Motor Vehicle Crash (MVC), pedestrians struck by vehicles, falls from significant height
 Suspect fracture in mechanisms with pelvic, low back or groin pain AND SBP <90mmHg or Pediatric age specific hypotension
q Pelvic stabilization is an important intervention in the management of severe pelvic trauma , and has 4 primary objectives
 Prevent re-injury from pathologic pelvic movement (most important), decrease pelvic volume, tamponade bleeding pelvic bones and
vessels, decrease pain
 Pelvic fractures have a high potential for significant intraperitoneal hemorrhage and blood
Procedure:
q Appropriately expose the patient and identify the greater trochanters bilaterally
q Assessment of the pelvis should be performed with extreme care
 Inspect for ecchymosis, deformity, asymmetry, pelvic or lower extremity wounds
 Palpate the skeletal structures – iliac crests, ischial tuberosity, lumbar spine and sacrum, greater trochanters
q Place a sheet or pelvic binder under the patient with the center at the level of the greater trochanters
q Tighten commercially available pelvic binder per manufacturer instruction
q With sheet binder, tighten by twisting and secure to maintain tension
q Assess for distal pulses before and after application
q Pelvic fractures have a high potential for significant intraperitoneal hemorrhage
Contraindications:
q Isolated femoral neck fracture
q Suspected traumatic hip dislocation
q Pelvic binding my exacerbate injury in iliac wing fractures and injuries with an over-riding pubic symphysis
*PEARL: The greater trochanters should be the area of pressure application, and are generally lower than you think!
