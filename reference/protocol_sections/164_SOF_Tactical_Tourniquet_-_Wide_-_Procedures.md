SOF Tactical Tourniquet - Wide - Procedures
175
Principles:
q Apply Tourniquet as proximal as possible to wound, minimum of 2" above hemorrhage site. Do not cross joints or bony prominences with
the Tourniquet
q Secure Tourniquet in place and expedite transport.
q Document time and location of tourniquet deployment in electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR) and on device.
q Notify receiving center of tourniquet use, location of device and time placed.
q IF hemorrhage not controlled, a second tourniquet can be deployed, proximal to the first without overlap.
Procedure:
1. Release the quick disconnect buckle, then
route the constricting band around the injured
limb.
2. Reconnect the quick disconnect buckle
3. Remove slack by pulling on the loose end of
the constricting band. Removing as much slack
as possible will increased efficacy of windlass.
4. Turn windlass until bleeding stops
completely. Wound may continue to seep but
there should be no active blood flow.
6. If possible, mark the time of tourniquet
application so the next provider is aware.
5. Stow windlass in tri-ring once bleeding is
controlled.
