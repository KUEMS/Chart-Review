Extremity Venous Access - Procedures
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q Appropriate tubing or IV lock
q #14-#24 catheter over the needle, or butterfly needle
q Venous tourniquet
q Antiseptic swab
q Gauze pad or adhesive bandage
q Tape or commercially available securing device
Procedure:
q 1. Saline locks may be used as an alternative to IV tubing and fluid under the authorization of the Service Medical Director and at the
discretion of the provider.
q 2. Intraosseous access can be used where threat to life exists as provided for in the Venous Access – Intraosseous Procedure.
q 3. Use the largest catheter bore necessary based upon the patient’s condition and size of veins
q 4. Fluid and set up choice is preferably:
 Normal Saline with macro drip (10 drops/mL) for medical/trauma conditions.
 Normal Saline with a micro drip (60 drops/mL) for medication infusions or for patients at risk of fluid overload.
q 5. Assemble IV solution and tubing:
 Open IV bag and check for clarity, expiration date, etc.
 Verify correct solution
 Open IV tubing and assemble according to manufacturer's guidelines
q 6. Insertion:
 Explain to the patient that an IV is going to be started
 Place the tourniquet around the patient’s arm proximal to the IV site, if appropriate
 Palpate veins for resilience
 Clean the skin with the antiseptic swab in an increasing sized concentric circle and follow it with an alcohol swab
 Stabilize the vein distally with the thumb/fingers
 Enter the skin with the bevel of the needle facing upward
 Enter the vein, obtain a flash, and advance the catheter into the vein while stabilizing the needle
 Remove the needle while compressing the proximal tip of the catheter to minimize blood loss
 Remove the tourniquet
 Connect IV tubing to the catheter, or secure the IV lock to the catheter to minimize blood loss
 Open the IV clamp to assure free flow (no infiltration, pain, etc) and set infusion rate
q 7. Secure the IV:
 Secure the IV catheter and tubing
 Recheck IV drip rate to make sure it is flowing at appropriate rate.
q 8. Trouble shoot the IV, (if the IV is not working well):
 Make sure the tourniquet is off
 Check the IV insertion site for swelling
 Check the IV tubing clamp to make sure it is open
 Check the drip chamber to make sure it is half full
 Lower the IV bag below IV site and watch for blood to return into the tubing
