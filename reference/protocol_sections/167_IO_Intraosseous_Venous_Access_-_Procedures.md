IO Intraosseous Venous Access - Procedures
Procedure:
q 1. Select the appropriate insertion site and palpate the appropriate bony landmarks to identify the site of insertion .
 The PROXIMAL HUMERUS is contraindicated in patients <18 years old, UNLESS authorized by Medical Control.
q 2. Cleanse the site with chlorhexidine, iodine or alcohol prep pad.
q 3. Device insertion
 Manual devices (Cook or Jamshidi):
q Hold the intraosseous needle at a 90odegree angle to the bony surface, aimed away from the nearby joint and epiphyseal plate.
q Provide pressure to push the needle tip through the skin until resistance from the bone is felt.
q Twist the needle handle with a rotating grinding motion applying controlled downward force until a “pop” or loss of resistance is
felt.
q Do not advance more than 1cm after the loss of resistance is felt.
 Powered Intraosseous Device (EZ-IO):
q Hold the intraosseous needle at a 90odegree angle to the bony surface, aimed away from the nearby joint and epiphyseal plate.
q Provide pressure to push the needle tip through the skin until resistance form the bone is felt.
q Power the driver until a “pop” or loss of resistance is felt.
q Do not advance more than 1cm after the loss or resistance is felt.
 Automatic Intraosseous Device (NIO):
q Rotate the cap 90° in either direction to unlock
q Place dominant hand over cap, and press device against patient. While pressing down on the device with palm, pull trigger wings
upwards with fingers
q Gently pull the NIO up in a rotating motion while holding the needle stabilizer against the insertion site
q Continue holding the needle stabilizer in place and pull up the stylet to remove.
q 4. Remove the stylet and place in an approved sharps container
q 5. Attach a 10mL syringe filled with 5mL of Normal Saline; aspirate bone marrow to verify placement, then inject 5mL of Normal Saline to
clear the lumen of the needle.
q 6. Attach the IV line with fluids on a pressure bag.
q 7. Stabilize and secure the needle with dressings and tape
q 8. Document the procedure, time, and procedure success (or failure) on the PCR
Complications:
● Incorrect identification of landmarks
● A bent needle (more common with longer needles)
● Clogging of the needle with marrow, clot or bone spicules.
-Can be avoided by flushing the needle or continuous infusion
● Through and through penetration of both anterior and posterior cortices
caused by excess force after the needle has penetrated the cortex.
● Subcutaneous or subperiosteal infiltration, caused by incomplete
placement or dislodgement of needle.
● Fractures caused by excess force or fragile bones.
● Compartment syndrome
Anterior Tibia
Proximal Humerus
(Hand Over Umbilicus
Technique)
Proximal Humerus
(“Thumb-to-Bum”
Technique)
Anteromedial aspect of the proximal tibia (bony prominence below
the kneecap). The insertion location will be 1-2cm (2 finger widths)
below this.
Keeping the elbow flat on the floor and close to the side of the
body, rotate the palm over the umbilicus (belly button) and palpate
the greater tubercle of the humerus. The insertion location will be
1-2cm (2 finger widths) above the surgical neck.
With the arm fully extended and tight to the body, rotate the hand
medially (inward) until the palm is facing out. Palpate the greater
tubercle of the humerus approximately 1-2cm (2 finger widths)
above the surgical neck.
Contraindications:
 Fracture proximal to proposed intraosseous site
 History of Osteogenesis Imperfecta
 Current or prior infection at proposed
intraosseous site
 Previous intraosseous insertion or joint
replacement at the selected site
