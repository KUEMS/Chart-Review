External Jugular Venous Access - Procedures
Clinical Indications:
q Medical patients who are awake and alert, and require IV access but are peripherally exhausted
q External jugular cannulation can be attempted initially in life threatening events when no obvious peripheral site is noted .
Prepare All Procedure Specific Materials:
q Appropriate tubing or IV lock
q #14-#24 catheter over the needle or butterfly needle
q Antiseptic swab
q Gauze pad or adhesive bandage
q Tape or other securing device
Procedure:
q 1. Position yourself at the head of the patient.
q 2. Place the patient in a slight Trendelenburg (supine, head down) position if possible. This helps distend the vein and prevent air embolism.
q 3. Turn the patient’s head toward the opposite side if no risk of cervical injury exists.
q 4. Prep the site with antiseptic swab.
q 5. Align the catheter with the vein (insertion direction is away from the patient’s head, toward the patient’s same side shoulder).
q 6. Anchoring the vein lightly with one finger above the clavicle, puncture the vein at a superficial angle midway between the angle of the
jaw and the clavicle and cannulate the vein.
q 7. Confirm placement with saline flush.
q 8. Attach the IV and secure the catheter (avoiding circumferential dressing or taping around the neck).
q 9. If unsuccessful, place occlusive dressing over site and do NOT go to other side of neck
q 10. Document the procedure appropriately.
Contraindications:
q Patient combative or uncooperative with positioning (i.e. unable to hold still while procedure is being performed)
q Anterior neck hematoma/burn/cellulitis
q Anatomic landmarks not visible
q Medical appliance in place covering anterior neck (i.e. c-collar)
q Monitor for complications
 Expanding hematoma
 Tracheal shift
 Difficulty breathing
*PEARL: Superficial insertion angle is crucial as the carotid artery is in close proximity to the EJ.
