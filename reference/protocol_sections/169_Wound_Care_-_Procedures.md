Wound Care - Procedures
Clinical Indications:
Skin and soft tissue wounds with associated bleeding and pain.
Procedure:
q 1. Use personal protective equipment, including gloves, gown and mask as indicated.
q 2. If active bleeding, elevate the affected area if possible and hold direct pressure. Do not rely on compression bandage to control bleeding. Direct
pressure is much more effective
q 3. Consider tourniquet use early for extremity bleeding not controlled with direct pressure.
q 4. Once bleeding is controlled, irrigate contaminated wounds with saline as appropriate
 Consider Pain Management Protocol before beginning irrigation.
 Irrigation and decontamination are key to stopping ongoing tissue injury, preventing infection and promoting wound healing.
 Control bleeding and address life threats first.
 Irrigate thermal burns, chemical burns or contaminated wounds with Normal Saline, Lactated Ringer’s or sterile water.
 For chemical splashes to the eye, emergent irrigation is critical to preventing further tissue damage. If possible, have patient remove contact lenses as
early as possible. Go to Eye Pain Protocol, as appropriate.
q 5. Cover wounds with sterile gauze/dressings. Check distal pulses, sensation, and motor function to ensure the bandage is not too tight.
q 6. Monitor wounds and/or dressing throughout transport for bleeding
q 7. Bolster existing bandages as necessary if saturation or
q 8. Consider second tourniquet use as indicated in protocol/procedure. Do not remove first tourniquet; apply the second higher on the limb.
q 9. If serious hemorrhage not controlled by other means:
 Apply approved non-heat generating hemostatic agent per manufacturer’s directions.
 Supplement hemostatic agent impregnated gauze with direct pressure and standard hemorrhage control techniques
 Apply additional hemostatic impregnated gauze and/or standard dressings as needed.
 Hemostatic impregnated gauze is contraindicated in wounds involving the thoracic cavity or violating the peritoneum of the abdominal cavity.
q 10. Document the wound assessment and care in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
Clinical Indications:
Skin and soft tissue wounds with MAJOR bleeding not controlled by direct pressure or tourniquet deployment as above .
Procedure:
q 1. Use personal protective equipment, including gloves, gown and mask as indicated.
q 2. Apply direct pressure to the wound
q 3. Insert finger(s) into the wound and apply firm pressure to visualized bleeding vessel to control bleeding .
q 4. Create a small ball at the beginning of the roll gauze (preferentially hemostatic impregnated)
q 5. Press the gauze deep into the wound, occluding the bleeding vessel against bone or firm tissue.
q 6. While maintaining pressure on the leading edge of the gauze, begin to feed more gauze into the wound, packing it tightly in place while
continuing pressure on the bleeding vessel.
q 7. Continue packing the wound until you have filled the wound space -OR- until you have a minimum 2-3" of gauze remaining
 Leave an adequate “tail” on packing to facilitate later removal at the hospital
q 8. Maintain manual direct pressure on the wound for 3-5 minutes.
q 9. Reassess and wrap the wound with a pressure dressing to maintain pressure for support.
q 10. If bleeding persists, apply more gauze but DO NOT remove the wound packing.
q 11. Continue monitoring the wound and assess for continued direct pressure as needed throughout transport.
q 12. Document the wound assessment and patient care in the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR).
