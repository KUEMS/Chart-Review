Ventricular Assist Device - Procedures
Frequently Asked Questions:
What is a Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)?
A ventricular assist device (VAD) is a mechanical pump that is used to support heart funciton and blood flow in people who have weakened hearts.
Some common reasons for VAD implantation are MI, Heart Failure, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy and heart surgery.
How does a VAD work?
The device takes blood from a lower chamber of the heart and helps pump it to the body and vital organs, just as a healthy heart would.
What are the parts of a VAD?
The basic parts of a VAD include: a small tube that carries blood out of your heart into a pump; another tube that carries blood from the pump to your
blood vessels, which deliver blood to your body; and a power source.
What is the power source?
The power source is either batteries or AC power. The power source is connected to a control unit that monitors the VAD functions. The batteries are
carried in a case usually located in a holster in a vest around the patient’s shoulders.
What does the control unit (or controller) do?
The control unit gives warnings or alarms if the power is low or if it senses that the device isn’t functioning properly.
MOST patients have a tag located on the controller around their waist that lists the type of device, the institution that put it in and a number to call.
Patient Management:
q 1. Assess the patients airway and intervene per the Airway Management Protocol
q 2. Auscultate heart sounds to determine if the device is functioning and what type of device it is. If it is a continuous flow device, you should
hear a “whirling sound”.
q 3. Assess the device for any alarms.
q 4. Look on the controller located around the patient’s waist or in the VAD PAK and see what device it is.
q 5. Assess Vital Signs – use Mean BP with Doppler, if available. The first sound you will hear is the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)
q 6. If no Doppler available, use the Mean on the Non-Invasive BP cuff
q 7. Intervene appropriately based on the type of alarm and patient guide.
 If patient is not responsive, has evidence of inadequate perfusion, and LVAD appears to be functioning---Perform external chest compressions
and follow ACLS protocol
 If patient is not responsive, has evidence of inadequate perfusion, and LVAD does NOT appear to be functioning---assess for a pulse
If NO pulse, perform external chest compressions and follow ACLS protocol
If pulse palpated, follow appropriate medical protocol, consider likely decompensated heart failure and proceed to chest
compressions only if pulses are lost.
q 8. Start one large bore IV
q 9. Transport to the closest VAD Center. Call the number listed on the device for advice.
q 10. Bring all of the patient’s equipment and paperwork to the Emergency Department.
q 11. Allow the trained caregiver to ride in the patient compartment when possible. They may be able to serve as an expert on the device if the
patient is unconscious or unable to answer for themselves.
Quick Tips for Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs)
q Let the patient and/or caregiver take the lead; they will be your on-scene experts.
q Remember not to perform chest compressions because they could dislodge the pump, making the patient bleed to death. Use the assistance of
the VAD coordinator before starting compressions in the case of obvious arrest and pump failure.
q Defibrillate / cardiovert as normal. Do NOT place the pads over the device that is under the patient’s skin.
q Keep in mind it may be difficult to obtain an accurate SpO2 because of little or no pulse.
q BE CAREFUL WHEN REMOVING / CUTTING CLOTHING so you don’t inadvertently dislodge or cut the drive line.
q Take the patient’s emergency travel bag when leaving the scene. It should have an extra controller, batteries and the VAD Coordinator’s
emergency contact number.
