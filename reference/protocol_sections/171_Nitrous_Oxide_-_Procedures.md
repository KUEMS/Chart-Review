Nitrous Oxide - Procedures
Clinical Indications:
q Adult patients with acute pain.
q Nitrous Oxide should ONLY be used by patients who have the capacity to understand and the ability to perform self -administration of
inhaled medications.
Contraindications:
q Nitrous Oxide rapidly diffuses into air-filled spaces within the body and can significantly increase pressures exerted by gases. Therefore, it
should NOT be used in cases where there are or are suspected to be abnormal collections of air within the body . Some common examples
include but are not limited to:
 Pneumothorax
 Pulmonary Blebs (commonly seen in COPD)
 Air Embolism
 Small Bowel Obstruction
 Pneumocephalus (air within the skull)
 Eye Injury or Eye Surgery
 Recent Middle Ear Surgery
q Nitrous is known to be teratogenic and is contraindicated before the end of 3
rd trimester of pregnancy
q Altered mental status from head injury, alcohol or drugs
q Inability to follow commands and/or safely self-administer the medication
Preparation:
q Prepare all procedure specific materials:
q Set up Medical Director approved nitrous oxide system per manufacturer written procedure.
q Turn on exhaust fan in patient care area.
q Verify indications and contraindications prior to Nitrous Oxide administration
Procedure:
q 1. Instruct the patient to hold the face mask lightly on the face, covering the nose and mouth.
q 2. Instruct patient to breathe normally though the demand valve mask until pain at acceptable level or until patient no longer able to hold
the mask to their face. Personnel must not hold mask to patient’s face.
q 3. Turn off flow of nitrous oxide when patient completes self-administered dose.
q 4. Reassess patient’s pain at 3-5 minutes with pain scale. If pain not controlled, consider other pain management options.
q 5. Document start and stop times for Nitrous Oxide use. Do not exceed time permitted by NIOSH occupational exposure standards.
 In open, outside, well ventilated areas: no maximum time of administration
 Ambulance with open windows and exhaust fans running: Max of 30 minutes per 8 hour period.
q 6. Document Nitrous Oxide canister pressure at the start of administration and at the end of administration.
q 7. Record vital signs during and after treatment (Nitrous Oxide may cause BP to drop in some cases).
Special notes:
q Nitrous oxide is in liquid state in its bottle. Ensure the bottle remains in the upright position when the bottle is open and especially during
patient administration.
q Nitrous oxide can potentiate the effects of other CNS depressants such as narcotics, sedatives, hypnotics and alcohol.
q Patients on chronic opiates may be highly tolerant to the analgesic effects of nitrous.
q Nitrous oxide is minimally metabolized in humans, and therefore retains its potency when exhaled into the room by the patient; a
continuous-flow fresh-air ventilation system and/or N2O scavenger system must be used to prevent waste gas buildup in the passenger
compartment.
