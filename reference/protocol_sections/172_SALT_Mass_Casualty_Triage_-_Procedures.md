SALT Mass Casualty Triage - Procedures
Clinical Indications:
q It is important to use a Triage strategy any time there is a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI), or when limited resources need to be allocated to
maximize the number of survivors
q SALT is an evidence-based, non-proprietary triage system developed in 2008.
q SALT stands for “Sort, Assess, Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment and/or Transport” and is based on the Model Uniform Core Criteria
(MUCC) for Mass Casualty Incidents
q Only appropriate for critical patients
Procedure:
q Step 1 – Global Sorting
 Patients who can walk should be asked to move to a designated area and should be assigned LAST priority for individual assessment
 Those who remain should be asked to wave or be observed for purposeful movement, those who do not move and those with obvious
life-threatening conditions should be assessed FIRST because they are the most likely to need lifesaving interventions
q Step 2 – Assess and Lifesaving Interventions
 Control major hemorrhage through the use of tourniquets or direct pressure provided by other patients or other devices
 Open the airway through positioning or basic airway adjuncts (no advanced airway devices should be used); if the patient is a child,
consider giving 2 rescue breaths
 Chest decompression procedure (see p163)
 Autoinjector antidote administration
 *Lifesaving interventions should be performed only within the responder’s scope of practice and only if the equipment is
immediately available
q Step 3 – Treatment and/or Transport
 Priortize patients for treatment and/or transport based on 1 of 5 categories;
 Minimal (GREEN) – Mild injuries that are self-limited if not treated, and can tolerate a delay in care without increasing mortality
 Dead (BLACK) – Not breathing even after lifesaving interventions are attempted
 Immediate (RED) – Do not obey commands, do not have a peripheral pulse, are in respiratory distress or have uncontrolled major
hemorrhage
 Expectant (GRAY) – Provider determines injuries are incompatible with life given the current available resources
 Delayed (YELLOW) – All patients who do not fit into one of the categories above
 The prioritization process is dynamic and may be altered by changing patient conditions, resources and scene safety
 In general, treatment and/or transport should be provided for immediate patients first, then delayed, then minimal; EXPECTANT
patients should be provided with treatment and/or transport when resources permit
 Efficient use of transport assets may include mixing categories of patients and using alternate forms of transport
