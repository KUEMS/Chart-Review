Base Hospital Activation - Procedures
Clinical Indications:
q It is important to activate the Base Hospital any time there is a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI), or when limited resources need to be
allocated to maximize the number of survivors
 An MCI (Mass Casualty Incident) is defined as any incident anticipated to result in more than five patients requiring EMS transport
from the scene.
q Excellent communication between EMS and receiving hospitals will help coordination of care , optimize patient distribution to real time
hospital capabilities and improve outcomes during a large scale event or MCI.
Procedure:
q Step 1 – Establish Incident Command early
 The first in unit will generally take Command of the incident, ensure that Base Hospital has been activated.
 In accordance with ICS structure, EMS can keep Command, pass Command or assimilate into the Unified Command structure.
q Step 2 – Establishment of EMS Branch
 The person in charge of EMS activities should assume the role of EMS Branch Director . This Director is tasked with assigning and
supervising the roles of: Triage Group Supervisor, Treatment Group Supervisor, Transportation Group Supervisor
 Consider assigning a record keeper to the Transportation Group Supervisor, to complete the form for after-action reporting
q Step 3 – Establish Radio Contact with Base Hospital
 Transportation Group Supervisor should be on the “Base Hospital Talk Group” to speak with Base Hospital. All hospitals are expected to
monitor this channel during a large event for information, but only Base Hospital has authority to speak
 Address the Base as “Base Hospital”; the contact person will be providing objective data regarding resource availability , regardless of
their primary hospital affiliation
 Base Hospital will provide the real time capabilities of all hospitals that have answered the EMResource alert at that time
¾ This will be listed as the number of each category of patients that the hospitals can manage at that moment
q Step 4 – Triage and Treatment
 Patients should be triaged and managed in accordance with the SALT Triage Procedure (see p183 for details)
q Step 5 – Transportation
 The Transportation Group Supervisor is responsible for assigning triaged patients to the most appropriate transportation mode based on
acuity and resource availability
 Transportation Group Supervisor should notify Base Hospital of destination, number and acuity of patients as they are assigned and leave
the scene
 Base Hospital will track the patient assignments, and will regularly update hospital capabilities as the event unfolds . Updates on
capabilities will be regularly reported, and should be available upon request by the Transportation Group Supervisor
¾ Like EMS, Hospital capabilities are NOT static; Walk-ins, security threats as well as increased staff presence can all impact the ability
of our hospitals to receive and manage patients. Frequent and clear communication about the situation and the capabilities on both
sides will be essential to successfully managing any event and optimizing patient outcomes.
 Hospital communication by transporting ambulances are conducted on the same channel as routine . Reports expected to be BRIEF and
CONCISE so as to keep radio traffic to a minimum; it is likely there will be many trying to access these channels
q Step 6 – Event Resolution
 Once all patients have cleared the scene, a final notification to Base Hospital should be made, with final tally of the number and types of
patients taken to each facility. This will be important for patient tracking, family reunification and after action reports
