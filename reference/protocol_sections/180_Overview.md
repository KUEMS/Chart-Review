Overview
Overview
The purpose of this section is to serve as a drug information supplement and to provide a brief description of the out -of-hospital medications that
are authorized by International SOS EMS. This document in no way represents the comprehensive pharmaceutical knowledge required for use of
these medications by Emergency Medical Technicians providing field care . The comprehensive information about the use of these medications by
practicing EMTs and paramedics , requires reference to other detailed sources.
Pregnancy Categories are listed for each of the medications in this book. The pregnancy category of a medication is an assessment of the risk of
fetal injury due to the pharmaceutical, if it is used as directed by the mother during pregnancy. It does not include any risks conferred by
pharmaceutical agents or their metabolites in breast milk.
Category A – Adequate and well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is
no evidence of risk in later trimesters).
Category B - Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well -controlled studies
in pregnant women.
Category C - Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in
humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks .
Category D - There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or
studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks .
Category X - Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and /or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based
on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly
outweigh potential benefits.
Medications are listed alphabetically based on generic names.
