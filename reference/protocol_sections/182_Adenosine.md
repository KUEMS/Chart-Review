Adenosine
193
Adenosine
Mechanism of Action
Slows conduction through the AV node, can interrupt reentry pathways through the AV node, and can restore normal sinus rhythm in patients
with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; decreases cardiac oxygen demand, decreasing hypoxia
Uses
PSVT, as a diagnostic aid to assess myocardial perfusion defects in CAD, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
Unlabeled Uses: Wide-complex tachycardia diagnosis
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity, 2
nd
- or 3
rd
-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breast-feeding, children, geriatric patients, asthma, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, bronchospastic lung
disease, symptomatic bradycardia, bundle branch block, heart transplant, unstable angina, COPD, hypotension, hypovolemia, vascular heart
disease, CV disease
Protocol Uses
Tachycardia With A Pulse, Adult (p43), Tachycardia With A Pulse, Peds (p98)
Side Effects
CNS: Lightheadedness, dizziness, arm tingling, numbness, headache
CV: Chest Pain, pressure, atrial tachydysrhthmias, sweating, palpitations, hypotension, facial flushing, AV block, cardiac arrest, ventricular
dysrhythmias, atrial fibrillation
GI: Nausea, metallic taste
Resp: Dyspnea, chest pressure, hyperventilation, bronchospasm (asthmatics)
Pharmacokinetics
Cleared from plasma in <30sec, half-life 10sec, converted to inosine/adenosine monophosphate
Pregnancy Category - C
Interactions
Increase: risk for higher degree of heart block – Carbamazepine
Increase: risk for ventricular fibrillation – digoxin, verapamil
Increase: effects of adenosine – dypridamole
Decrease: activity of adenosine – theophylline or other methylxanthines (caffeine)
EMT Considerations
Assess cardiopulmonary status – BP, pulse, respiration, rhythm, ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT); check for transient dysrhythmias (PVCs, PACs, sinus
tachycardia, AV block)
Assess respiratory status – rate, rhythm, lung fields for crackles; watch for respiratory depression; bilateral crackles may occur in CHF patient;
increased respiration, increased pulse, product should be discontinued
CNS effects – dizziness, confusion, psychosis, paresthesias, seizures; product should be discontinued
Treatment of Overdose
Defibrillation, vasopressor for hypotension, theophylline
