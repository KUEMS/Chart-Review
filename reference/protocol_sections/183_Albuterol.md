Albuterol
194
Albuterol
Mechanism of Action
Beta2-adrenergic agonist. Activates beta2 receptors on airway smooth muscle, increasing the cyclic AMP concentration, increasing activation of
protein kinase A and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, leading to muscle relaxation.
Uses
Bronchospasm associated with asthma, exercise induced asthma, COPD
Unlabeled Uses: Hyperkalemia
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to sympathomimetics, tachydysrhythmias, severe cardiac disease, heart block
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breast-feeding, cardiac/renal disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, prostatic hypertrophy, angle-closure
glaucoma, seizures, exercise-induced bronchospasm (aerosol) in children <12 y/o, hypoglycemia
Protocol Uses
Guidelines For Use of Protocols (p9), Paramedic Intercept Guidelines (p23), Radio Report Format (p28), COPD/Asthma/Stridor – Adult (p35),
Allergic Reaction – Adult (p46), Prolonged Crush Injury – Adult, Trauma (p73), Hazmat, General – Adult, Trauma (p79);
Destination Determination – Pediatric (p88), Wheezing / Asthma – Pediatric (p93), Allergic Reaction – Pediatric (p100), Prolonged Crush Injury –
Peds, Trauma (p120)
Side Effects
CNS: Tremors, anxiety, insomnia, headache, dizziness, stimulation, restlessness, hallucinations, flushing, irritability
CV: Palpitations, tachycardia, angina, hypo/hypertension, dysrhythmias
EENT: Dry nose, irritation of nose and throat
GI: Heartburn, nausea, vomiting
MS: Muscle cramps
Resp: Cough, wheezing, dyspnea, parodoxical bronchospasm, dry throat
Misc: Flushing, sweating, anorexia, bad taste/smell changes, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis
Pharmacokinetics
Extensively metabolized in the liver and tissues, crosses placenta, breast mild, blood-brain barrier
INH – onset 5-15min, peak 1-1.5hr, duration 3-6hr, half-life 4hr
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase: QTc prolongation – other drugs that increase QT prolongation
Increase: ECG changes/hypokalemia – potassium wasting diuretics
Increase: action of albuterol – tricyclics, MAOIs, other adrenergics; do not use together
Decrease: effectiveness of albuterol – other β-blockers
EMT Considerations
Respiratory Function: vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, ABGs; lung sounds, hear rate and rhythm, BP, sputum (baseline and peak);
whether patient has not received theophylline therapy before giving dose
Evaluate: therapeutic response: absence of dyspnea, wheezing after 1hr, improved airway exchange, improved ABG
Treatment of Overdose
Administer β1-adrenergic blocker, IV Fluids
