Amiodarone
195
Amiodarone
Mechanism of Action
Prolongs duration of action potential and effective refractory period, noncompetitive a- and b-adrenergic inhibition; increases PR and QT
intervals, decreases sinus rate, decreases peripheral vascular resistance
Uses
Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation not controlled by 1
st
-line agents
Unlabeled Uses: Atrial fibrillation treatment/prophylaxis, atrial flutter, cardiac arrest, cardiac surgery, CPR, heart failure, PSVT, Wolff-ParkinsonWhite (WPW) syndrome, supraventricular tachycardia
Contraindications
Black Box Warning – 2
nd
- and 3
rd
-degree AV block, bradycardia, severe hepatic disease, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary fibrosis
Pregnancy (D), breastfeeding, neonates, infants, severe sinus node dysfunction, hypersensitivity to this product/iodine/a=benzyl alcohol,
cardiogenic shock
Precautions
Children, goiter, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, electrolyte imbalance, CHF, respiratory disease, torsades de pointes
Protocol Uses
Cardiac Arrest – Adult (p37), Tachycardia With a Pulse – Adult (p43), Tricyclic Overdose – Adult (55);
Cardiac Arrest, General – Peds (p95), Tachycardia with a Pulse – Peds (p98),
Double Sequential Defibrillation – Procedure (p158)
Side Effects
CNS: Headache, dizziness, involuntary movement, tremors, peripheral neuropathy, malaise, fatigue, ataxia, paresthesia, insomnia
CV: Hypotension, bradycardia, sinus arrest, CHF, dysrhythmias, SA node dysfunction, AV block, increased defibrillation energy
EENT: Blurred vision, halos, photophobia, corneal microdepositis, dry eyes
GI: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, hepatotoxicity
MS: weakness, pain in extremities
Resp: Pulmonary fibrosis/toxicity, pulmonary inflammation, ARDS; gasping syndrome if used with neonates
Misc: Flushing, abnormal taste or smell, edema, abnormal salivation, coagulation abnormalities
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized by liver (CYP3A4, CYP2C8), excreted by kidneys, 99% protein binding
Pregnancy Category – D
Interactions
Increase: QT prolongation – azoles, fluoroquinolones, macrolides
Increase: amiodarone concentration, possible serious dysrhythmias – protease inhibitors, reduce dose
Increase: anticoagulation effects - warfarin
Increase: bradycardia – b-blockers calcium channel blockers
EMT Considerations
Evaluate: therapeutic response: decreased in ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, fibrillation
CNS Symptoms: confusion, psychosis, numbness, depression, involuntary movements; product should be discontinued
Treatment of Overdose
O2, artificial ventilation, ECG, administer dopamine for circulatory depression, administer diazepam for seizures
