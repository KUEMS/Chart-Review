Mechanism of Action
Blocks pain impulses in CNS, reduces inflammation by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; antipyretic action results from vasodilation of
peripheral vessels; decreases platelet aggregation

Mild to moderate pain or fever including RA, osteoarthritis, thromboembolic disorders; TIAs, rheumatic fever, post-MI, prophylaxis of MI,
ischemic stroke, angina, acute MI
Unlabeled Uses: Prevention of cataracts, Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, PCI

rd trimester, breastfeeding, children <12 y/o, children with flu-like symptoms, hypersensitivity to salicylates, GI bleeding,
bleeding disorders, intracranial bleeding, nasal polyps, urticaria
Precautions
Abrupt discontinuation, acid/base imbalance, alcoholism, ascites, asthma, bone marrow suppression in elderly, G6PD deficiency, gout, heart
failure, anemia, renal/hepatic disease, gastritis, pregnancy (C) 1
st trimester

Pharmacokinetics
Enteric metabolism by liver; inactive metabolites excreted by kidneys; crosses placenta; excreted in breast mild; half-life 15-20min
Pregnancy Category – D
Interactions
Increase: gastric ulcer risk – corticosteroids, anti-inflammatories, NSAIDs, alcohol
Increase: bleeding – alcohol, plicamycin, thrombolytics, anticoagulants
Increase: hypotension - nitroglycerin
Decrease: effects of aspirin – antacids (high dose), urinary alkalizers, corticosteroids
EMT Considerations
Allergic reactions: rash, urticaria; if these occur, product may have to be discontinued; patients with asthma, nasal polyps allergies: severe
allergic reaction may occur
Ototoxicity: tinnitus, ringing, roaring in ears; audiometric testing needed before, after long-term therapy
Treatment of Overdose
Lavage, activated charcoal, monitor electrolytes, VS
