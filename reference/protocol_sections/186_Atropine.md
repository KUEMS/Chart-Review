Atropine

Atropine
Mechanism of Action
Blocks acetylcholine at parasympathetic neuroeffector sites; increases cardiac output, heart rate by blocking vagal stimulation in heart; dries
secretions by blocking vagus nerve stimulation
Uses
Bradycardia <40-50bpm, bradydysrhythmia, reversal of anticholinesterase agents, insecticide poisoning, blocking cardiac vagal reflexes,
decreasing secretions before surgery, antispasmodic with GU, biliary surgery, bronchodilator, AV heart block
Unlabeled Uses: Cardiac arrest, CPR, diarrhea, pulseless electrical activity, ventricular asystole, asthma
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to belladonna alkaloids, closed-angle glaucoma, GI obstructions, myasthenia gravis, thyrotoxicosis, ulcerative colitis, prostatic
hypertrophy, tachycardia, asthma, acute hemorrhage, severe hepatic disease, myocardial ischemia
Precautions
Pregnancy ©, breastfeeding, children <6 y/o, geriatric patients, renal disease, CHF, hyperthyroidism, COPD, hypertension, Down Syndrome,
spastic paralysis, gastric ulcer
Protocol Uses
Bradycardia With a Pulse – Adult (p44), Cholinergic / Organophosphate Overdose – Adult (p56), Beta Blocker Overdose – Adult (p55), Cardiac
Arrest, General – Peds (p95), Bradycardia with a Pulse – Peds (p99)
Side Effects
CNS: Headache, dizziness, involuntary movement, confusion, psychosis, anxiety, coma, flushing, drowsiness, insomnia, delirium
CV: Hypo/hypertension, paradoxical bradycardia, angina, PVCs, tachycardia, ectopic ventricular beats, bradycardia
EENT: Blurred vision, photophobia, glaucoma, eye pain, pupil dilation, nasal congestion
GI: Dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, paralytic ileus, abdominal distention, altered taste
GU: Retention, hesitancy, impotence, dysuria
Skin: Rash, urticaria, contact dermatitis, dry skin, flushing
Misc: Suppression of lactation, decreased sweating, anaphylaxis
Pharmacokinetics
Half-life 2-3hr, terminal 12.5hr. Excreted by kidneys unchanged (70-90% in 24hr), metabolized in liver 40-50% crosses placenta
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase: mucosal lesions – potassium chloride tab
Increase: anticholinergic effects – tricyclics, amantadine, antiparkinson agents
Decrease: effect of atropine – antacids
EMT Considerations
Assess ECG for ectopic ventricular beats, PVCs, tachycardia. Assess for increased intraocular pressure; eye pain, nausea, vomiting, blurred
vision, increased tearing
Treatment of Overdose
O2, artificial ventilation, ECG; administer dopamine for circulatory depression; administer diazepam for seizures; assess need for
antidysrhythmics
