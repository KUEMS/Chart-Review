Calcium
Mechanism of Action
Needed for maintenance of nervous, muscular, skeletal function; enzyme reactions; normal cardiac contractility; coagulation of blood; affects
secretory activity of endocrine, exocrine glands
Uses
Prevention and treatment of hypocalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hypoparathyroidism, neonatal tetany, cardiac toxicity caused by hyperkalemia,
lead colic, hyperphosphatemia, Vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis prophylaxis, calcium antagonist toxicity
Unlabeled Uses: Electrolyte abnormalities in cardiac arrest, CPR
Contraindications
Hypercalcemia, digoxin toxicity, ventricular fibrillation, renal calculi
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breastfeeding, children, respiratory/renal disease, cor pulmonale, patient in digoxin, respiratory failure, diarrhea
Protocol Uses
Cardiac Arrest – Adult (p37), Beta Blocker Overdose – Adult (p55), Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose – Adult (p55), Prolonged Crush Injury –
Adult, Trauma (p73); Cardiac Arrest, General – Peds (p95), Overdose and Poisoning, General – Peds (p105), Prolonged Crush Injury – Peds
(p120)
Side Effects
CV: Shortened QT, heart block, hypotension, bradycardia, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest
GI: Vomiting, nausea, constipation
Hypercalcemia: Drowsiness, lethargy, muscle weakness, headache, constipation, coma, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria,
Skin: Pain, burning at IV site, severe venous thrombosis, necrosis, extravasation
Pharmacokinetics
Crosses placenta, enters breast milk, excreted via urine and feces, half-life unknown, protein binding 40-50%
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase: dysrhythmias – digoxin glycosides
Increase: toxicity - verpamil
Decrease: effects of atenolol, verapamil
EMT Considerations
Assess: ECG for decreased QT and T-wave inversion; seizure precautions with padded side rails, decreased stimuli, place airway suction
equipment
Evaluate: therapeutic response with decreased twitching, paresthesias, muscle spasms; absence of tremor, seizure or dysrhythmia
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product; supportive care
