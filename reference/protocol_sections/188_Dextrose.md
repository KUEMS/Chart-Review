Dextrose
Mechanism of Action
Needed for adequate utilization of amino acids; decreases protein, nitrogen loss; prevents ketosis
Uses
Increases intake of calories; increases fluids in patients unable to take adequate fluids, calories orally; acute hypoglycemia
Contraindications
Hyperglycemia, delirium tremens, hemorrhage (cranial/spinal), CHF, anuria, allergy to corn products
Precautions
Cardiac/renal/hepatic disease, diabetes mellitus, carbohydrate intolerance
Protocol Uses
Documentation of Vital Signs (p18), Radio Report Format (p28), Cardiac Arrest – Adult (p37), Diabetic Emergencies – Adult (p48), Beta Blocker
Overdose – Adult (p55), Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose – Adult (p55), Opioid Overdose – Adult (p55), Cocaine and Sympathomimetic
Overdose – Adult (p55), Neonatal Resuscitation – Peds (p94), Cardiac Arrest, General – Peds (p95), Diabetic Emergencies – Peds (p103)
Side Effects
CNS: confusion, loss of consciousness, dizziness
CV: hypertension, CHF, pulmonary edema, intracranial hemorrhage
Endo: Hyperglycemia, rebound hypoglycemia, hyperosmolar syndrome, hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome, aluminum toxicity, hypokalemia,
hypomagnesium
GI: Nausea
GU: Glycosuria, osmotic diuresis
Skin: Chills, flushing, warm feeling, rash, urticarial, extravasation necrosis
Resp: Pulmonary edema
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized at the cellular level to carbon dioxide and water.
Oral – onset 10 minutes, peak 40 minutes; IV – onset immediate, peak 30 minutes
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase: fluid retention/electrolyte excretion—corticosteroids
EMT Considerations
Assess: Electrolytes (Potassium), blood glucose; Injection site for extravasation (redness along vein, edema at site, necrosis, pain/tenderness),
site should be changed immediately
Evaluate: Therapeutic response
Treatment of Overdose
Insulin; discontinue product; supportive care
