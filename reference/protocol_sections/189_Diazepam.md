Diazepam
200
Diazepam
Mechanism of Action
Potentiates the actions of GABA, especially in the limbic system, reticular formation; enhances presympathetic inhibition, inhibits spinal
polysynaptic afferent paths
Uses
Anxiety, EtOH withdrawal, seizure disorder, muscle relaxation
Contraindications
Pregnancy (D), hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, closed -angle glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, EtOH intoxication, liver disease
Precautions
Breastfeeding, children <6 months, geriatric patients, COPD, CNS depression, labor, Parkinson’s disease, psychosis
Protocol Uses
Seizure – Peds (p109)
Side Effects
CNS: Dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, headache, anxiety, tremors, fatigue, hallucinations, ataxia
CV: Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, hypotension
EENT: Blurred vision, tinnitus, mydriasis, nystagmus
GI: Constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea
Heme: Neutropenia
Resp: Respiratory depression
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized by the liver via CYP2C19, CYP3A4; excreted by kidneys, crosses the placenta, excreted in breast mild; crosses the blood-brain
barrier; half life 20-50 hours. IM: Onset 15-30min, duration 1-1½ hour; IV: Onset immediate, duration 15 min-1 hour
Pregnancy Category – Not Assigned
Interactions
Increase: Diazepam effect – amiodarone, diltiazem, disulfiram, ketoconazole, nicardipine, verapamil, valproic acid
Increase: toxicity – barbiturates, SSRIs, cimetidine, CNS depressants, valproic acid, CYP3A4 inhibitors
Increase: CNS depression – EtOH
Decrease: Diazepam metabolism – oral contraceptives, valproic acid, disulfiram, propranolol
Decrease: Diazepam effect – CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, barbiturates, carbamazepein, phenytoin, fosphenytoin), smoking
EMT Considerations
Assess BP (lying, standing), pulse; respiratory rate,
Assess EtOH withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations (visual, auditory), delirium, irritability, agitation, fine or coarse tremor
Assess IV site for thrombosis or phlebitis, which may occur rapidly
Evaluate therapeutic response – decreased anxiety, restlessness, muscle spasms
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, supportive care, monitor VS
