Diltiazem

Diltiazem
Mechanism of Action
Inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membrane during cardiac depolarization; produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle, dilates
coronary arteries, slows SA/AV node conduction times, dilates peripheral arteries
Uses
Angina pectoris due to coronary artery spasm, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
Contraindications
Sick sinus syndrome, AV heart block, hypotension <90mmHg systolic, acute MI, pulmonary congestion, cardiogenic shock
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breastfeeding, children, geriatric patients, CHF, aortic stenosis, bradycardia, GERD, hepatic disease, hiatal hernia, ventricular
dysfunction
Protocol Uses
Tachycardia With a Pulse – Adult (p43), Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose – Adult (p55)
Side Effects
CNS: Headache, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, depression, weakness, insomnia, tremor, paresthesias
CV: dysrhythmia, edema, CHF, bradycardia, hypotension, palpitations, heart block
GI: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastric upset, constipation, increased LFTs
GU: Nocturia, polyuria, acute renal failure
Skin: Rash, flushing, photosensitivity, burning or itching at injection site
Resp: Rhinitis, dyspnea, pharyngitis
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized by the liver, excreted in the urine (96% as metabolites)
IV – onset 30-60 min; peak 2-3 hours
Pregnancy Category – D
Interactions
Increase: toxic effects – theophylline
Increase: effects of -blockers, digoxin, lithium, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, anesthetics, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitorys, benzodiazepines,
lovastatin, methylprednisolone
Increase: effects of diltiazem – cimetidine
EMT Considerations
Assess for CHF – look for dyspnea, weight gain, edema, jugular venous distention, rales,
Assess dysrhythmias – BP, pulse, respiratory rate, ECG and PR intervals, QRS and QT intervals
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, atropine for AV block, vasopressors for hypotension
