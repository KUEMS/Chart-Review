Epinephrine
204
Epinephrine (Adrenaline)
Mechanism of Action
β1- and β2-agonist causing increased levels of cAMP, thereby producing bronchodilation, cardiac and CNS stimulation; high doses cause
vasoconstriction via alpha-receptors; low doses can cause vasodilation vai β2-vascular receptors
Uses
Acute asthma attacks, hemostasis, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, allergic reactions, cardiac arrest, shock
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to sympathomimetics, sulfites, closed-angle glaucoma, nonanaphylactic shock during general anesthesia
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breastfeeding, cardiac disorders, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, organic brain
syndrome, local anesthesia in certain areas, labor, cardiac dilation, coronary insufficiency, cerebral atherosclerosis, organic heart disease
Protocol Uses
Termination of Resuscitation (p15), COPD / Asthma / Stridor – Adult (p35), Cardiac Arrest – Adult (p37), Bradycardia With a Pulse – Adult (p44),
Allergic Reaction – Adult (p46), Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose – Adult (p55), Hypotension / Shock (Non-Trauma) – Adult (p63),
Hypotension / Shock (Trauma) – Adult (p85), Wheezing / Asthma – Peds (p93), Neonatal Resuscitation – Peds (p94), Cardiac Arrest, General –
Peds (p95), Post Resuscitation Care – Peds (p97), Bradycardia With a Pulse – Peds (p99). Allergic Reaction – Peds (p100), Hypotension / Shock
(Non-Trauma) – Peds (p110)
Side Effects
CNS: Tremors, anxiety, insomnia, headache, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, cerebral hemorrhage, weakness, drowsiness
CV: Palpitations, tachycardia, hypertension, dysrhythmias, increased T wave
GI: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting
MISC: Sweating, dry eyes
Resp: Dyspnea
Pharmacokinetics
Crosses placenta, metabolized in the liver. IM – onset variable, duration 1-4 hours; Inhaled - onset 1-5 minutes, duration 1-3 hours
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Do not use with MAOIs or tricyclics; hypertensive crisis may occur.
Toxicity: other sympathomimetics
Decrease: hypertensive effects – β-adrenergic blockers
EMT Considerations
Assess Asthma – auscultate lungs, pulse, BP, respiratory rate and effort, sputum
ECG completed when continuous albuterol administered
Sulfite sensitivity may be life-threatening
Allergic reactions, bronchospasms
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, administer α -blocker and β -blocker
