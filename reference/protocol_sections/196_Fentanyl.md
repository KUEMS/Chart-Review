Fentanyl
207
Fentanyl
Mechanism of Action
Inhibits ascending pain pathways in the CNS, increases pain threshold, alters pain perception by binding to opiate receptors
Uses
Controls moderate to severe pain; adjunct to general anesthetic, adjunct to regional anesthesia; conscious sedation
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to opiates, myasthenia gravis
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breastfeeding, geriatric patients, increased intracranial pressure, seizure disorders, severe respiratory disorders, cardiac
dysrhythmias
Protocol Uses
Post Advanced Airway Sedation – Adult, Medical (p34), Opioid Overdose – Adult (p55), Pain Management – Adult (p58), Post Resuscitation Care
– Peds (p97), Pain Management – Peds (p107), Sickle Cell Crisis – Peds (p111)
Side Effects
CNS: Dizziness, euphoria, sedation
CV: Bradycardia, arrest, hypo/hypertension
EENT: Blurred vision, miosis
GI: Nausea, vomiting, constipation
Skin: Rash, diaphoresis
MS: Muscle rigidity
Resp: Respiratory depression, arrest, laryngospasm
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized by liver, excreted by kidneys, crosses placenta, excreted in breast milk. Half-life IV: 2-4 hours
IM: onset 7-8 minutes, peak 30 minutes, duration 1-2 hours. IV: Onset 1 minute, peak 3-5 minutes, duration ½ - 1 hour
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase: fentanyl effect (fetal respiratory depression) – cyclosporine, ketoconazole, cimetidine, fluconazole, nefazodine, zafrilukast
Increase: hypotension – droperidol
Increase: CV depression – diazepam
Increase: fentanyl effect with other CNS depressants – EtOH, opioids, sedative/hypnotics, antipsychotics, skeletal muscle relaxants, protease
inhibitors
Decrease: fentanyl effect – CYP3A4 inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin)
EMT Considerations
Assess vital signs, note muscle rigidity, drug history, hepatic or renal failure
Assess for CNS changes – dizziness, drowsiness, hallucinations, euphoria, LOC, pupil reaction
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, naloxone
