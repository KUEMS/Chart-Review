Glucose (Oral)
209
Glucose
Mechanism of Action
Needed for adequate utilization of amino acids; decreases protein, nitrogen loss; prevents ketosis
Uses
Increases intake of calories; increases fluids in patients unable to take adequate fluids, calories orally; acute hypoglycemia
Contraindications
Inability to swallow effectively, impaired airway reflexes / inability to protect airway, hyperglycemia, delirium tremens, hemorrhage (cranial/
spinal), CHF, anuria, allergy to corn products
Precautions
Cardiac/renal/hepatic disease, diabetes mellitus, carbohydrate intolerance

Side Effects
CNS: confusion, loss of consciousness, dizziness
CV: hypertension, CHF, pulmonary edema, intracranial hemorrhage
Endo: Hyperglycemia, rebound hypoglycemia, hyperosmolar syndrome, hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome, aluminum toxicity, hypokalemia,
hypomagnesium
GI: Nausea
GU: Glycosuria, osmotic diuresis
Skin: Chills, flushing, warm feeling, rash, urticarial, extravasation necrosis
Resp: Pulmonary edema
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized at the cellular level to carbon dioxide and water
Oral – onset 10 minutes, peak 40 minutes
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase: fluid retention/electrolyte excretion—corticosteroids
EMT Considerations
Assess: Mental status and appropriateness for oral medications, electrolytes (Potassium), blood glucose
Evaluate: Therapeutic response
Treatment of Overdose
Insulin, IVF, discontinue product, supportive care
