Haloperidol
Mechanism of Action
Depresses cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, limbic system, which control activity and aggression; blocks neurotransmission produced by
dopamine at synapse; exhibits, strong α-adrenergic, anticholinergic blocking action; mechanism for antipsychotic effects unclear
Uses
Psychotic disorders, control of tics, vocal utterances in Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome, short-term treatment of hyperatcive children showing
excessive motor activity, prolonged parenteral therapy in chronic schizophrenia, organic mental syndrome with psychotic features, hiccups
(short-term), emergency sedation of severely agitated or delirious patients, ADHD
Unlabeled uses: Intraoperative nausea, vomiting; autism; migraine
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity, coma, Parkinson’s disease
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breastfeeding, geriatric patients, seizure disorders, hypertension, pulmonary/cardiac/hepatic disease, QT prolongation, torsades
de pointes, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, children, blood dyscrasias, brain damage, bone marrow depression, EtOH
and barbiturate withdrawal states, angina, epilepsy, urinary retention, closed angle glaucoma, CNS depression Black Box Warning: Increased
mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis

Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized by liver, excreted in urine, bile; crosses placenta; enters breast mild; protein binding 92%; terminal half-life 12-36 hours
(metabolites) IM: Onset 15-30 minutes, peak 15-20 minutes, half life 21 hours
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase: serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome – SSRIs, SNRIs
Increase: QT prolongation – class 1A, III antidysrhythmics, tricyclics, amoxapine, maprotiline, phenothiazines, pimozide, risperidone,
sertindole, ziprasidone, β-blockers, chloroquine, clozapine, dasatinib, dolasetron, droperidol, dronedarone, flecainide, methadone,
erythromycin, ondansetron, tacrolimus
Increase: oversedation – other CNS depressants, EtOH, barbiturate anesthetics
Increase: toxicity – epinephrine, lithium
Decrease: effects – lithium, levodopa
EMT Considerations
Assess patient response to medications, scene safety, evaluate for dystonic reaction
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, supportive care, ECG monitoring, diphenhydramine for dystonia
