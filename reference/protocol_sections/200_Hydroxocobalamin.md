Hydroxocobalamin

Hydroxocobalamin
Mechanism of Action
Precursor to cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12). Cyanocobalamin acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic functions including fat and carbohydrate
metabolism and protein synthesis. In the presence of cyanide, each hydroxocobalamin molecule can bind one cyanide ion and form
cyanocobalamin, which is then excreted in the urine.
Uses
Cyanide antidote, vitamin B12 deficiency, pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 malabsorption syndrome, increased requirements with pregnancy,
thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, renal/hepatic disease, nutritional supplementation
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity, optic nerve atrophy
Precautions
Pregnancy (A), breastfeeding, children
Protocol Uses
Cyanide Poisoning – Adult (p57)
Side Effects
CNS: Flushing, optic nerve atrophy
CV: CHF, peripheral vascular thrombosis, pulmonary edema
GI: Diarrhea
Skin: Itching, rash, pain at injection site
Endo: Hypokalemia
Systemic: Anaphylactic shock
Pharmacokinetics
Stored in liver/kidneys/stomach; 50%-90% excreted in urine; crosses placenta; excreted in breast milk
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase: absorption—prednisone
Decrease: absorption—aminoglycosides, anticonvulsants, colchicine, chloramphenicol, aminosalicylic acid, potassium preparations, cimetidine
EMT Considerations
Assess: For vitamin B12 deficiency (red/beefy tongue, psychosis, pallor, neuropathy); For pulmonary edema, worsening of CHF in cardiac
patients
Perform/provide: Protection from light, heat
Evaluate: Therapeutic response:, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, paresthesias, psychosis, visual disturbances
