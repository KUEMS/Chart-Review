Ketamine

Ketamine
Mechanism of Action
Produces a cataleptic-like state in which the patient is dissociated from the surrounding environment by direct action on the cortex and limbic
system. Noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist that blocks glutamate in the brain. Low doses produce analgesia and modulate central
sensitization, hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance. Reduces polysynaptic spinal reflexes.
Uses
Induction and maintenance of general anesthesia
Unlabeled uses: Complex regional pain syndrome, analgesia, sedation
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity, conditions in which increased blood pressure would be hazardous. Additional contraindications per American College of
Emergency Physicians (ACEP) – Infants <3 months of age, known or suspected schizophrenia (even if currently stable or controlled with
medications)
Precautions
Increased intracranial pressure, increased ocular pressure, thyroid disorders, cardiovascular disease, respiratory depression, airway
complications, CNS depression, emergence reaction
Ketamine crosses the placenta and can be detected in fetal tissue; it is not known if ketamine is excreted in breast milk
Protocol Uses
Rapid Sequence Airway – Adult (p33), Post Advanced Airway Sedation - Adult, Medical (p34), Behavioral Emergencies – Adult (p47), Pain
Management – Adult (p58); Rapid Sequence Airway – Peds (p91), Post-Airway Sedation – Peds (p92), Behavioral Emergencies – Peds (p101)
Side Effects
CNS: Prolonged emergence, confusion, hallucinations, irrational behavior, increased CSF pressure, hypertonia (may resemble seizures), drug
dependence
CV: Bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension, HTN, tachycardia
Derm: Erythema (transient), morbilliform rash (transient), rash at injection site
Endo: Central diabetes insipidus
GI: Anorexia, nausea, sialorrhea (drooling), vomiting
EENT: Diplopia, increased intraocular pressure, nystagmus
Resp: Airway obstruction, apnea, respiratory depression, laryngospasm
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized in liver via hydroxylation and N-demehtylation, excreted primarily in the urine
IV – onset 30 seconds, peak 5-10 minutes; IM – onset 3-4 minutes, peak 12-25 minutes. Half life 2.5 hours
Pregnancy Category – Not Assigned
Interactions
Increase: CNS depression – alcohol, buprenorphine, cannabis, magnesium sulfate, minocycline, mirtazapine, zolpidem, hydrocodone,
antihistamines, thalidomide
Increase: active metabolites – quazepam, stiripentol,memantine
Ketamine may increase the toxic effects of – memantine, mifepristone, thiopental, SSRI antidepressants
EMT Considerations
Assess heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, SpO2
Assess for emergence reaction
Assess cardiac function continuously in patients with increased blood pressure or cardiac decompensation
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product; respiratory support for laryngospasm and respiratory depression, airway suctioning for increased salivation and
secretions, supportive care for psychomotor agitation and hallucinations
