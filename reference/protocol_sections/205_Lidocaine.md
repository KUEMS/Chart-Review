Lidocaine
216
Lidocaine
Mechanism of Action
Increases electrical stimulation threshold of ventricle, His-Purkinje system, which stabilizes cardiac membrane, decreases automaticity
Uses
Ventricular tachycardia, ventricular dysrhythmias during cardiac surgery, digoxin toxicity, cardiac catheterization
Unlabeled uses: Attenuation of intracranial pressure increases during intubation/endotracheal tube suctioning
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to amides, severe heart block, supraventricular dysrhythmias, Adams-Stokes syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
Precautions: Pregnancy (B), breastfeeding, children, geriatric patients, renal/hepatic disease, CHF, respiratory depression, malignant
hyperthermia, myasthenia gravis, weight <50 kg
Protocol Uses
Cardiac Arrest, General – Peds (p95), IO Intraosseous Venous Access – Procedure (p178)
Side Effects
CNS: Headache, dizziness, involuntary movement, confusion, tremor, drowsiness, euphoria, seizures, shivering
CV: Hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, CV collapse, arrest
EENT: Tinnitus, blurred vision
GI: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia
Hematology: Methemoglobinemia
Skin: Rash, urticaria, edema, swelling, petechiae, pruritus
Misc: Febrile response, phlebitis at injection site
Resp: Dyspnea, respiratory depression
Pharmacokinetics
Half-life 8 min, 1-2 hr (terminal); metabolized in liver; excreted in urine; crosses placenta
IV: Onset 2 minutes, duration 20 min
Pregnancy Category – B
Interactions
Increase: cardiac depression, toxicity—amiodarone, phenytoin, procainamide, propranolol
Increase: hypotensive effects—MAOIs, antihypertensives
Increase: neuromuscular blockade—neuromuscular blockers, tubocurarine
Increase: lidocaine effects—cimetidine, beta blockers, protease inhibitors, ritonavir
Decrease: lidocaine effects—barbiturates, ciprofloxacin, voriconazole
Decrease: effect of—cyclosporine
Decrease: effect—coltsfoot
EMT Considerations
Assess: ECG continuously to determine increased PR or QRS segments; if these develop, discontinue or reduce rate; watch for increased
ventricular ectopic beats, may have to re-bolus; Blood pressure; Malignant hyperthermia (tachypnea, tachycardia, changes in BP, increased
temp); Respiratory status (rate, rhythm, lung fields for crackles, watch for respiratory depression); CNS effects (dizziness, confusion, psychosis,
paresthesias, convulsions-- product should be discontinued)
Evaluate: Therapeutic response: decreased dysrhythmias
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, O2, artificial ventilation, ECG; administer Dopamine for circulatory depression, diazepam for seizures
