Magnesium

Magnesium
Mechanism of Action
When taken orally, promotes bowel evacuation by causing osmotic retention of fluid which distends the colon with increased peristaltic activity .
Parenteral infusion decreases acetylcholine in motor nerve terminals and acts on myocardium by slowing rate of SA node impulse formation
and prolonging conduction time. Magnesium is necessary for the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium into and out of the cells as well
as stabilizing excitable membranes.
Uses
Anticonvulsant for preeclampsia/eclampsia
Unlabeled uses: persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), cardiac arrest, CPR, digitoxin/digoxin toxicity, premature labor,
seizure prophylaxis, status asthmaticus, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, obstruction, acute surgical abdomen, rectal bleeding, heart block, myocardial damage
Precautions: Pregnancy (A), renal/cardiac disease
Protocol Uses
Asthma / COPD – Adult (p35), Cardiac Arrest – Adult (p37), Tachycardia With A Pulse – Adult (p43), OB General – Adult (p50), Beta Blocker
Overdose – Adult (p55), Seizure – Adult (p61), Wheezing / Asthma – Peds (p93), Seizure – Peds (p109)
Side Effects
CNS: Muscle weakness, flushing, sweating, confusion, sedation, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia
CV: Hypotension, heart block, circulatory collapse, vasodilation
GI: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, cramps, diarrhea
Hematology: Prolonged bleeding time
Metabolic: Electrolyte, fluid imbalances
Resp: Respiratory depression/paralysis
Pharmacokinetics
Protein binding 30% to albumin, excreted in the urine as magnesium
IM – onset 1 hour, duration 3-4 hours; IV – onset immediate, duration 30 min
Pregnancy Category – D
Interactions
Increase: effect of neuromuscular blockers
Increase: hypotension—antihypertensives
Decrease: absorption of tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin
Decrease: effect of digoxin
EMT Considerations
Assess: Eclampsia (seizure precautions, BP, ECG)
Evaluate: Therapeutic response (absence of seizures, stabilization of dysrhythmia, improvement in respiratory status)
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product; support respirations with positive pressure ventilation, supportive care
