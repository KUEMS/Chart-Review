Mark 1 Kit
Mark I NAAK (“Nerve Agent Antidote Kit”) is a dual-chamber autoinjector with two anti-nerve agent drugs. The kits are only effective against
the nerve agents tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD) and VX. It may also be used in cases of agricultural insecticide exposure, as
organophosphates are a key component of the agent. Common examples of insecticides using organophosphates are malathion, parathion,
diazinon, fenthion, dichlorvos, ethion and trichlorfon.
Mechanism of Action
Atropine counters the parasympathetic response from the muscarinic receptor overstimulation associated with organophosphate and nerve
agent poisoning, and reverses the SLUDGEM symptoms.
Pralidoxime chloride (“2-PAM”) binds to the organophosphate or nerve agent and changes the conformation of the molecule, which causes it
to lose its binding to the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. The joined poison / antidote then releases from the site and regenerates the enzyme,
allowing it to function again.
Uses
Organophosphate and nerve agent poisonings.
Contraindications
None in the emergency setting.
Precautions
Known hypersensitivity to the Mark I or DuoDote Kit and Pediatric patients under the age of 3 are relatively contraindicated.
Protocol Uses
Cholinergic / Organophosphate Overdose – Adult (p55)
Each kit contains: Atropine 2mg and Pralidoxime chloride 600mg
Minor initial symptoms – administer ONE Mark I Kit via autoinjector (IM)
Severe symptoms appearing within 10 minutes of first dose – administer ONE additional Mark I Kit via autoinjector (IM)
Severe symptoms present from the beginning – administer THREE Mark I Kits via autoinjector (IM)
Tube one (atropine) is always administered before tube two (2-PAM)
Side Effects
HEENT: Dry mouth
Skin: Flushing
CNS: Dilated pupils, Headache, Drowsiness
CV: Tachycardia
Interactions
Morphine, theophylline, aminophylline and succinylcholine should be avoided in patients with organophosphate poisoning.
Barbiturates are potentiated by the anticholinesterase enzyme and should be used cautiously when treating seizures in the poisoned patient.
EMT Considerations
The use of a Mark I Kit offers no prophylactic protection and should be administered only if symptoms are present.
There is a high potential for “off-gassing” from patients exposed to both organophosphates and nerve agents. In cases of “off-gassing”, vapors
are given off by chemically contaminated clothing or exhaled by poisoned individuals. EMS Providers should use all appropriate PPE including
SCBA and be vigilant when monitoring for symptoms in themselves and other responders. These patients are generally NOT safe for transport
by Helicopter EMS (HEMS).
