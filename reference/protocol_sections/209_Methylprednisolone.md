Mechanism of Action
In a tissue-specific manner, corticosteroids regulate gene expression subsequent to binding specific intracellular receptors and translocation
into the nucleus. Corticosteroids exert a wide array of physiologic effects including modulation of musculoskeletal, endocrine and neurologic
physiology are influenced by corticosteroids. Decreases inflammation by suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, reversal
of increased capillary permeability, and lysosomal stabilization
