Midazolam

Midazolam
Mechanism of Action
Binds to BZD receptors on the postsynaptic receptors on the postsynaptic GABA neuron at several sites within the CNS, including the limbic system, reticular
formation. Enhancement of GABA on neuronal excitability results in hyperpolarization (less excitable state) and stabilization. BZD receptors and effects appear
to be linked to GABAA receptors, BZDs do not bind GABAB receptors.
Uses
Seizure, anxiolysis, pre-sedation for intubation, anesthesia
Unlabeled uses: Status epilepticus
Contraindications
Pregnancy (D), hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, acute closed-angle glaucoma
Precautions
Breastfeeding, children, geriatric patients, COPD, CHF, chronic renal failure, chills, debilitated, hepatic disease, shock, coma, alcohol intoxication, status
asthmaticus
Protocol Uses
Airway Management – Adult (p32), Post Advanced Airway Sedation – Adult, Medical (p34), CHF / Pulmonary Edema – Adult (p36), Tachycardia With A Pulse –
Adult (p43), Bradycardia With A Pulse – Adult (p44), OB General – Adult (p50), Antipsychotic Overdose / Acute Dystonic Reaction – Adult (p55), Cocaine and
Sympathomimetic Overdose – Adult (p55), Tricyclic Overdose – Adult (p55), Seizure – Adult (p61), Bites and Envenomations – Adult, Trauma (p68),
Environmental, Hyperthermia – Adult, Trauma (p75), Airway Management – Peds (p90), Post Resuscitation Care – Peds (p97), Bradycardia with a Pulse – Peds
(p99), Seizure – Peds (p109), Bites and Envenomations – Peds, Trauma (p117), Environmental, Hyperthermia – Peds, Trauma (p122), Head Injury – Peds,
Trauma (p126)
Side Effects
CNS: retrograde amnesia, euphoria, confusion, headache, anxiety, insomnia slurred speech, paresthesia, tremors, weakness, chills, agitation, paradoxical
reactions
CV: hypotension, PVCs, tachycardia, bigeminy, nodal rhythm, cardiac arrest
EENT: blurred vision, nystagmus, diplopia, loss of balance
GI: nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, hiccups
Skin: urticaria, pain/swelling/pruritus at injection site, rash
Resp: coughing, apnea, bronchospasm, laryngospasms, dyspnea, respiratory depression
Pharmacokinetics
Protein binding 97%, half-life 1.8-6.4 hr, metabolized in liver; metabolites excreted in urine; crosses placenta and the blood brain barrier
IV – onset 3-5 minutes, duration <2 hours (6 hours in liver failure); IM – onset 15 minutes, duration 6 hours; IN – onset 4-8 minutes, duration 41 minutes
Pregnancy Category – D
Interactions
Increase: hypotension- antihypertensives, opiates, alcohol, nitrates
Increase: extended half-life—CYP3A4 inhibitors (cimetidine, erythromycin, ranitidine)
Increase: respiratory depression—other CNS depressants, alcohol, barbiturates, opiate analgesics, verapamil, ritonavir, indinavir
Decrease: midazolam metabolism—CYP3A4 inducers (azole antifungals, theophylline)
EMT Considerations
Assess: BP, pulse, respirations during IV; Injection site for redness, pain and swelling; Degree of amnesia in geriatric patients; may be increased; Anterograde
amnesia; Vital signs during recovery period in obese patients, since half-life may be extended
Preform/Provide: Assistance with ambulation until drowsy period ends; Storage at room temp, protect from light; Immediate availability of resuscitation
equipment, O2 to support airway, do NOT give by rapid bolus
Evaluate: Therapeutic response
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, supportive care, flumazenil (may induce seizures if used in patients with chronic benzodiazepine use), O2
