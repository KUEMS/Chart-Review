Naloxone
Mechanism of Action
Pure opioid antagonist that competes and displaces opioids at opioid receptor sites
Uses
Opiate overdose, respiratory depression induced by opioids, pentazocine, propoxyphene
Unlabeled uses: opiate-induced pruritis
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breastfeeding, children, neonates, CV disease, opioid dependency, seizure disorder, drug dependency
Protocol Uses
Documentation of Vital Signs (p18), Cardiac Arrest – Adult (p37), Opioid Overdose – Adult (p55), Neonatal Resuscitation – Peds (p94), Overdose
and Poisoning, General – Peds (p105)
Side Effects
CNS: Drowsiness, nervousness, seizures, tremor
CV: Rapid pulse, increase systolic BP (high doses), ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, hypo/hypertension, cardiac arrest, sinus tachycardia
GI: Nausea, vomiting, hepatotoxicity
Resp: Tachypnea, pulmonary edema
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized by liver, crosses placenta; excreted in urine/breast milk
IV – onset 1 minute, duration 45 min. Half-life 30-81 minutes
Pregnancy Category – B
Interactions
Increase: seizures - tramadol
Decrease: effect of opioid analgesics
EMT Considerations
Assess: Withdrawal: cramping, hypertension, anxiety, vomiting; signs of withdrawal in drug-dependent individuals may occurs <2 hours after
administration;
Vital Signs q3-5 minutes;
Cardiac Status: tachycardia, hypertension, monitor ECG ;
Respiratory Function: respiratory depression, character, rate, rhythm, if respiration <10/min, administer naloxone; probably due to opioid
overdose; monitor LOC;
Pain: duration, intensity, location before and after administration
Preform/Provide: Dark storage at room temp
Evaluate: Therapeutic Response: reversal of respiratory depression; change in level of consciousness
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product; supportive care
