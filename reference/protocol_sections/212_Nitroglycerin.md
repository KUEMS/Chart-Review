Nitroglycerin

Nitroglycerin
Mechanism of Action
Produces a vasodilator effect on the peripheral veins and arteries with more prominent effects on the veins. Primarily reduces cardiac oxygen
demand by decreasing preload (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure). May modestly reduce afterload. Dilates coronary arteries and improves
collateral flow
Uses
Unstable angina, Hypertension, Flash Pulmonary Edema
Unlabeled use: esophageal spasms, uterine relaxation, short-term management of pulmonary hypertension
Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity, increased intracranial pressure, cerebral hemorrhage
Precautions
Used with caution in postural hypotension, pregnancy, breastfeeding, children, renal disease, hepatic injury, inferior STEMI
Protocol Uses
CHF / Pulmonary Edema – Adult (p36), Chest Pain / Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome – Adult (p41), ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction –
Adult (p42)
Side Effects
CNS: Headache, flushing, dizziness
CV: Hypotension, tachycardia, collapse, syncope, palpitations
GI: Nausea, vomiting
Skin: Pallor, sweating, rash
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized by liver, excreted in urine
Half-life 1-4 min.
Sublingual – onset 1-3 minutes, duration 30 minutes. IV – onset 1-2 minutes, duration 3-5 minutes
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Severe hypotension, CV collapse: alcohol
Increase: effects of beta-blockers, diuretics, antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers
Increase: erectile dysfunction meds (fatal hypotension - sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil; do not use together)
Increase: nitrate level - aspirin
Decrease: heparin - IV nitroglycerin
EMT Considerations
Assess: Orthostatic BP, pulse; Pain: duration time started, activity being preformed, character; Tolerance: if taking over long period of time;
Headache, lightheadedness, decreased BP
Perform/Provide: Storage protected from light, moisture; store in cool environment
Evaluate: Therapeutic response: decrease in anginal pain
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, IV fluids, supportive care
