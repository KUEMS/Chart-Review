Nitrous Oxide
Mechanism of Action
The mechanism of action of nitrous oxide is not completely understood . It is trifold and includes analgesia, anxiolysis and anesthesia.
Its analgesic mechanism of action is described as opioid in nature and may involve a number of spinal neuromodulators.
The anxiolytic effect is similar to that of benzodiazepines and may involve gamma aminobutyric (GABA) receptors
The anesthetic mechanism may involve GABA and possibly N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as well.
Uses
Nitrous is commonly used in dental surgery and as part of a procedural sedation during short, painful procedures in the Emergency Department. It acts as an analgesic
and mild sedative when dispensed at the standard 2:1 ratio of N2O to O2. It is often used with other anesthetics.
Unlabeled use:
Nitrous is sometimes used in auto racing. It is safe and stable at room temperature, but at ~600oC it decomposes into a gas with 33% oxygen per unit volume.
Atmospheric air has only ~21% oxygen and thus can burn less fuel in a given volume.
Nitrous is commonly used as a short-term euphoric high which features audio and visual strobing effects. This use is generally illegal.
Contraindications
Respiratory compromise, or inability to reliably follow commands.
Nitrous rapidly diffuses into air-filled cavities, and patients in whom expansion of these air-filled cavities could compromise patient safety. This includes patients with
pneumothorax, pulmonary blebs, air embolism, bowel obstruction, and those undergoing surgery of the eye or middle ear.
Nitrous is known to be teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy.
Precautions
Patients on chronic opiates may be highly tolerant to the analgesic effects of nitrous. When animals are given morphine chronically, they develop tolerance to its painkilling effects, and this also renders the animals tolerant to the analgesic effects of N2O.
Because nitrous oxide is minimally metabolized in humans (with a rate of 0.004%), it retains its potency when exhaled into the room by the patient, and can pose an
intoxicating and prolonged exposure hazard to the staff if the room is poorly ventilated. Where nitrous oxide is administered, a continuous-flow fresh-air ventilation
system or N2O scavenger system must be used to prevent a waste-gas buildup.
Protocol Uses
Pain Management – Adult (p58), Pain Management – Peds (p107), Nitrous Oxide – Procedure (p199)
Inhalational gas that MUST be self-administered by the patient.
Side Effects
CNS: Headache (especially if pt. not given inhaled O2 for 5 min after administration), Blurred Vision, Lethargy
CV: Orthostatic Hypotension, Dizziness, Faintness, or Lightheadedness
GI: Nausea, Vomiting
Heme: Methemoglobinemia
Misc: Exposure to nitrous oxide may cause vitamin B12 deficiency. It inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin B12 by oxidation. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency,
including sensory neuropathy, myelopathy, and encephalopathy, may occur within days or weeks of exposure to nitrous oxide anesthesia in people with subclinical
vitamin B12 deficiency.
Pharmacokinetics
Onset of action: Inhalation: 2-5 minutes
Absorption: Rapid via lungs; blood/gas partition coefficient is 0.47
Metabolism: Body: <0.004%
Excretion: Primarily exhaled gases; skin (minimal amounts)
Half-life: Approximately 5 minutes; depends on patient ventilatory volume, rate and quality. In general, the clinical effects of nitrous cease when inhalation stops, with
minimal residual effect.
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Increase:effects of CNS depressants (EtOH, benzodiazepines, opiates, cannabis)
EMT Considerations
Assess: Vital signs for systemic hypotension
Perform/Provide: Store at room temperature, should be stored in a cool, fire resistant area away from heat sources and combustibles
Evaluate: Therapeutic response
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product; IV Fluids; 100% inhaled O2 (preferably via NRB); antiemetics; supportive care
