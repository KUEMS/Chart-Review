Rocuronium
Mechanism of Action
Blocks acetylcholine from binding to receptors on motor endplate inhibiting depolarization . Inhibits transmission of nerve impulses by binding
with cholinergic receptor sites, antagonizing action of acetylcholine
Uses
Facilitation of endotracheal intubation; skeletal muscle relaxation during mechanical ventilation
Unlabeled use: preinduction to blunt defasciculation
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breastfeeding, children, geriatric patients, electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, respiratory/neuromuscular/cardiac/renal/
hepatic disease
Protocol Uses
Rapid Sequence Airway – Adult (p33), Rapid Sequence Airway – Peds (p91)
Side Effects
CV: Bradycardia, tachycardia, change in BP, edema
GI: Nausea, vomiting
Skin: Rash, flushing, pruritus, urticarial
MSK: Myopathy
Resp: Prolonged apnea, bronchospasm, cyanosis, respiratory depression, dyspnea, pulmonary vascular resistance
Pharmacokinetics
Metabolized in liver
Half-Life 30 min, duration 60-70 min
Pregnancy Category – B
Interactions
Theophylline increases risk of dysrhythmias
Increase: neuromuscular blockade caused by amphotericin B, verapamil, aminoglycosides, clindamycin, enflurane, isoflurane, lincomcin,
lithium, opiates, local anesthetics, polymyxin, anti-infectives, quinidine, thiazides
EMT Considerations
Assess: Vital Signs: BP, pulse, respirations, airway until fully recovered; Allergic reactions: rash, fever, respiratory distress, pruritus
Preform/Provide: Storage in light-resistant area, stable at room temp for 30 days
Evaluate: Therapeutic response
Treatment of Overdose
