Succinylcholine
229
Succinylcholine
Mechanism of Action
Acts similar to acetylcholine, producing depolarization of the motor endplate at the myoneural junction which causes sustained flaccid skeletal
muscle paralysis.
Uses
Facilitation of endotracheal intubation
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity, malignant hyperthermia, trauma (crush injuries)
Precautions
Pregnancy (C), breastfeeding, geriatric or debilitated patients, cardiac disease, severe burns, fractures (fasciculations may increase damage),
electrolyte imbalances (hyperkalemia), dehydration, neuromuscular disease, respiratory/cardiac/renal/hepatic disease, collagen disease,
glaucoma, eye surgery
Protocol Uses
Rapid Sequence Airway – Adult (p33), Rapid Sequence Airway (RSA) – Peds (p91)
Side Effects
CV: Bradycardia, tachycardia, hypo/hypertension, sinus arrest, dysrhythmias, edema
EENT: Increased secretions, Increased intraocular pressure
Heme: Myoglobinemia
Skin: Rash, flushing, pruritus, urticaria
MSK: Weakness, muscle pain, fasciculations, prolonged relaxation, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis
Resp: Prolonged apnea, bronchospasm, cyanosis, respiratory depression, wheezing, dyspnea
Systemic: anaphylaxis, angioedema, malignant hyperthermia
Pharmacokinetics
Hydrolyzed in blood, excreted in urine
IV - onset 1 min, peak 2-3 min, duration 6-10 min
Pregnancy Category – C
Interactions
Dysrhythmias: theophylline
Increase: neuromuscular blockade- aminoglycosides, beta-blockers, cardiac glycosides, clindamycin, lincomycin, procainamide, quinidine, local
anesthetics, polymyxin antibiotics, lithium, opiates, thiazides, enflurane, isoflurane, magnesium salts, oxytocin
EMT Considerations
Assess: Electrolyte imbalances (potassium, magnesium); may lead to increase action of product; Vital Signs: BP, pulse, respirations, airway;
Recovery: decreased paralysis; Allergic Reactions: rash, fever, respiratory distress, pruritus
Perform/Provide: Storage in refrigerator powder at room temp
Evaluate: Therapeutic response: paralysis of jaw, eyelid, head, neck rest of body
Treatment of Overdose
Discontinue product, supportive care, Neostigmine, Atropine
