PRESSOR Receptor Main Effect Main Shock Use Other
Epinephrine a1, a2, b1, b2
Vasoconstriction
Inotropy (increased squeeze)
Dromotropy (increased
conduction through AV node)
Chronotropy (increased rate)
Anaphylaxis
Asthma
Cardiac Arrest
 Nonspecific a and b receptor activation Hard on myocardium Typically an add-on agent to norepinephrine in septic shock when an additional agent is required and
occasionally an alternative first-line agent if norepinephrine is contraindicated.
 Increases heart rate. May decrease mesenteric perfusion, may induce tachyarrhythmias and ischemia Must be diluted; eg, a usual concentration is 1 mg of 1:1,000 in 250 mL D5W (4 micrograms/mL).
Norepinephrine a1, b1 Vasoconstriction Inotropy Septic Shock Undifferentiated Shock
 First line med for most kinds of shock Initial vasopressor of choice in septic, cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. Wide range of doses used clinically. Must be diluted; a usual concentration is 4mg in 250mL of D5W or NS (16mcg/mL)
Phenylephrine a1 Vasoconstriction Hypotension (“push dose” pressors in the ED)
 May cause reflex bradycardia Pure alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor. Alternative vasopressor for patients with septic shock who: (1) develop tachyarrhythmias on norepinephrine, (2)
have persistent shock despite use of two or more vasopressor/inotropic agents including vasopressin (salvage therapy), or (3) high cardiac output with persistent hypotension.
 May decrease stroke volume and cardiac output in patients with cardiac dysfunction.  May be given as bolus dose of 50 to100 micrograms to support blood pressure during rapid sequence intubation.
Dobutamine b1, b2 Inotropy Vasodilation Cardiogenic Shock
 Minimal change in heart rate Hard on myocardium Initial agent of choice in cardiogenic shock with low cardiac output and maintained blood pressure. Add-on to norepinephrine for cardiac output augmentation in septic shock with myocardial dysfunction or
ongoing hypoperfusion despite adequate intravascular volume and MAP.
 Increases cardiac contractility and rate; may cause hypotension and tachyarrhythmias.
Dopamine a1, a2, b1, b2, DA
Vasoconstriction (high doses)
Inotropy
Dromotropy
Chronotropy
Septic Shock
(2nd line behind Norepinephrine)
 More adverse effects(eg, tachycardia, arrhythmias particularly at doses ≥20 mcg/kg/minute) and failed therapy
than norepinephrine.
 May be useful in selected patients (eg, with compromised systolic function or bradycardia at low risk for
tachyarrhythmias).
 Must be diluted; eg, a usual concentration is 400mg in 250mL D5W (1.6 mg/mL); use of a commercially available
pre-diluted solution is preferred.
Vasopressin V1 Vasoconstriction Norepinephrine sparing effect at low doses
 Add-on to another vasopressor (eg, norepinephrine) to augment efficacy and decrease initial vasopressor
requirement. Not recommended as a replacement for a first-line vasopressor.
 Pure vasoconstrictor; may decrease stroke volume and cardiac output in myocardial dysfunction or precipitate
ischemia in coronary artery disease.
 Must be diluted; eg, a usual concentration is 25units in 250mL D5W or NS (0.1 units/mL).
